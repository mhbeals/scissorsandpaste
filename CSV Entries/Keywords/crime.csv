Gen. Scott Major Fountain Major Willis Capt. M'Murtry and Lieut. Fortingham have all fallen sacrifices to the Indians after a terrible conflict on the banks of a river; there were such numbers of the Indians killedand thrown into the river that their dead bodies actually stopped the current of it.The frost is very intense at New YorkDuring the late gales of wind the smugglers have been uncommonly active on all the coasts of the kingdom. The risk of their lives secured their property–for the Custon-house boats were afraid to follow them.From many parts of the country we have received accounts of the land being entirely flooded by the late heavy rains.A prisoner who was tried last week try town sessions for stealing iron being acquitted by the Jury addressed them in the following words: Gentlemen I most sincerely thank you for your lenity and promise never to be guilty of the like offence again.,crime ID334,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,01,10,inform,From theNew York Journal. Winchester Oct. 20.By recent intelligence from Kentucky we learn that a short time ago an American vessel was seized at New Orleans and her cargo disposed of by the Spaniards.

The Legislature have also resolved that a Convention be called for taking into consideration the constitution of the United States; the members to be elected in December and the Convention to Meet the first week in Jauary. The Legislature have adjourned to meet again on the first Thursday in January for the purpose (we suppose) of choosing Senators and affixing the time and manner of electing Representatives for Congress.New York Nov. 18.The following resolution has passed the House of Representatives of the State of Virginia now in session: Resolved That so much of this act entitled An Act making provision for the provision for the debt of the United States in their redemption of the public debt is dangerous to the rights and subversive of the interest of the people; and demands the marked disapprobation of the General Assembly.Portland Nov. 15.The stone work of the light house at the entrance of our harbour is now completed. On Tuesday the 9th instant the last stone was laid by Mr. Nichols of this town master builder. The work is extremely well executed. The lighthouse is now 70 feet high.

From Wright's Ferry we learn that about four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon as a boat was coming from the East side a most tremendous storm arose when she was about half way over by which means she was soon filled with water and sunk. there was six passengers and the ??? in her (besides a small light waggon and three horses viz. a clergyman the owner of the waggon with his wife and three children; when the storm came on the woman and children took shelter in the waggon but it continued to blow with such violence that the waggon was torn out of the boat and the body having by chance got loose from the carriage and being pretty tight floated some distance till its progress was stopped by a rock; the husband viewing the melancholy situations of his wife and children resolved to relieve or perish with them and quitting the boat swam to the waggon cut open the cover with his knife and with difficulty kept their heads above water till they were relieved by a boat from the West side; by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappeared; the Clergyman just as he found the boat sinking mounted his horse one of the boatmen mounted on one of the waggon horses and by this means preserved themselves till they were relieved by a boat; the other boatman of the name of Tim Sulivan depending on his skill in swimming got up an oar but it is thought he is drowned as he has not since been heard of; the boat was found in the falls and one of the waggon horses that had been given up for lost was found next day some distance below the falls with all his geers on and does not appear to have received the least injury.Extract of a letter from Sunbury Northumberland County (Pennsylvania) dated Nov. 13.One of the men who murdered the Indians at Pine Creek was tried on Saturday evening and though a number of witnesses clearly proved the hand he had in perpetrating the horrid deed and the confession of his counsel at the bar that confirmed it yet notwithstanding an express charge from the judges to bring him in guilty the jury in a few moments returned with a verdict in his favour and a subscription to pay the costs of the suit that he might be immediately set at liberty; and all this from a most absurd idea which the Attorney General with all his endeavours could not beat out of them that the crime was not the same to kill an Indian as a white man: for some minuets the Chief Justice was mute with astonishment. How the State can pacify the Indians now Heaven knows while at this moment the other murderers are at large in this country and no one will arrest them.,crime ID97,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,09,12,entertain,The laws of the State of Pennsylvania and that of Massachusetts by which the punishment of death is abolished in all cases except for wilful murder are about to be adopted by the respective Legislatures of all the other States. The system of the great and merciful ???caria has taken place of the sanguinary Penal laws of England.The abolition ofNegro slavery which has taken shape in the five New England States of New Hampshire Massachusets Rhode island Connecticut and Vermont; in the Midland States of New York New Jersey Pennsylvania and Delawar; and in the Western State of Kentucky for several years past is now extended by act of Congress to the Southern States of Virginia North Carolina South Carolina Georgia and Maryland; and the emancipation of the remainder of that unfortunate race of men is to take place on or before the fifth of November 1795.The Legislature of the State of Massachusetts has g???ed a part of the public lands to the emancipated Negroes of that State in proportion to the numbers of the respective families where the liberal and philanthropic mind is gratified by seeing them erect villages cultivate farms and form communities of civilized Societies.Before the Gentleman who has favoured us with this Intelligence left America they had established a Lodge of Masonry; and he had the satisfaction of seeing them on a grand day parade to Church in all the magnificence of the Order where a sermon was preached on the occasion by one of their own colour. They have also endowed public schools employed ??? and erected places of Public Worship.The Officers Non-commissioned Officers and Soldiers who served in the Continental army and established the Liberty of their Country have at last received a reward infinitely beyond their expectations but every way corresponding with the liberty of a great and rising Republic.Five hundred acres of land have been voted by Congress this last Session to each individual who served throughout the war; and to the defendants of those who fell in contending for the Rights of Nature and eequal proportion to those who served for a shorter period; and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real value to the injury of the Patriotic Veteran as has been the case of former grants he is allowed his option of taking its value in sterling money at the present market price from the Treasure of the States; or any part in land and the rest in moneya s may be most agreeable to the receiver.The Mint of the United States which was established two years since has begun to issue its hold and silver coin: the copper has been delivered some time. The gold coins are eagles half eagles and quarter eagles.The first is exactly five and forty shillings English money or ten American coin.The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half and quater which makes the courie of exchange simple and suits the reckoning to a very capacity–as our Readers will perceive that ten quarter dollars make the quarter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle; and ten dollars the eagle.There is besides one more silver coin which is called a Dime and is the tenth part of a dollar.The copper coin is called a Cent and is the tenth part of a Dime.Six of the ships of war which were voted by Congress in November last are completed and put in commission: the remaining twenty four will be ready by Midsummer next and will complete a fleet of ??? hundred guns.The city of Washington which in five years more will be the Capital of the United States will in every respect be the first in the world: the Capitol or Congress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence and c??? a full and complete view of every part of the city as well as a considerable extent of the country around. The President's house likewise stands upon a rising ground near the banks of the Potamac possessing a delightful water prospect together with a commanding view of the Capitol and some other material parts of the city.From the President's house to the Capitol run two great pleasure parks or malls which intersect and terminate upon the banks of the Potomac and are ornamented at the sides by elegant buildings for Foreign Ministers. The four fronts of the Capitol as well as those of the President's house are of the finest marble. The building of these superb edifices has been much retarded by the want of stone cutters masons bricklayers carpenters and blacksmiths who at this time actually receive the enormous wages of ten shillings American currency per day.The district of Country at the back of North Carolina reaching to the Mississippi and covering a country six hundred miles long by three hundred broad is next winter to be formed into a Sixteenth State; and the Province of Maine extending from the borders of New Hampshire to the river St. Croix is expected to form a Seventeenth.The new cities build in America since her independence are Grenville in the State of Georgia; Martenberg the Capitol of North Carolina; Columbia the Capital of South Carolina; Noxville and Nashville in the Tenesee Settlements; Danville Fairfield and Lex ington in the State of Kentucky; Washington the Capital of the United States; Sunbury in the State of Pennsylvania; Hudson upon Husdon's River and Cooper's Town in the State of New York; Bennington in the State of Vermont; and Paterson in the State of New Jersey.

The emigrations from the different nations in Europe to that country are esimated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually.

Its fur though beautiful and magnificent is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of the Southern Provinces.Pekin is therefore the proper mart for this valuable commodity and in this immense city the consumption is so great that the produce of the voyage meets and immediate sale.The Mandarins of the Court and even the Emperor himself are fond of wearing this costly fur. To a citizen of common rank a sea otter's collar to his vestment is a luxury.The natives of the North West Coast of Ameerica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds that all the blankets cloths hats and stockings that could be procured in China if English manufacture were sold to the Indians with whose Chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed.An act of cruelty committed by an officer of the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to be recorded.The Spaniards discovering that Callicum a Chief second in authority at Nootka Sound was in alliance with the English he was shot through the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife of Callicum with an infant child escaped but not till wounded.Macquilla the Chief first in command retired at the head of the allies of England from Nootka Sound and to avoid the cruelty of the Spaniards they fled to distant parts. Such of the natives as they could seize the Spaniards condemned to work as slaves on their fortifications.At this period it was in the contemplation of the Spaniards to seize the Sandwich Islands with a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. And we further add on authority that amounts nearly to demonstration that on the very lands purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain Mears the Spaniards have already opened valuable mines.Another object of this enterprise wasto supply the markets of Kamschatka and other ports belonging to the Russians with the teas and other produce of China. This promised to be an invaluable channel of commerce as the Chinese have shut their ports against the Russians whoOn this voyage of discovery and experiment one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo but was unfortunately lost on her return to China.To these curious particulars we add with a patriot joy that the consumption of the glorious staple of England her broad cloths is astonishingly great in Japan and China: British hard ware &c. is also in great request.From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may depend on the utmost attention and civility.

Intelligence has been received that in some trivial dispute with a native Indian a Spaniard has stabbed him to the heart with a stiletto and then fled. The nation to whom the Indian belonged being made acquainted with the murder sent a deputation to the Governor demanding that five Spaniards should be instantly delivered up as an attonement. This was peremptorily refused as being more than commensurate to the offence but the murderer was offered as a satisfaction; the Indians would not accept him singly and departed vowing the severest revenge: a few days afterwards intelligence was received that they had surprised and massacred sixteen men who had been at work in the woods; and when the vessel departed the Spaniards were flying with the utmost precipitation and terror from all parts of the country seeking shelter in the forts.,crime ID354,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,10,08,entertain,Extract of a letter from Luxene County. On Saturday the 1st of July I left Tioga point near the middle of the day; about half after one o'clock P. M. a shower appeared to be rising from the north west and I had scarcely time to take shelter in the house of Obadiah Gore Esq; at Sheshequen before the storm came on attended with heavy thunder and lightening and a violent gale of wind with rain. The storm continued up wards of half an hour during which time to see the tumbling of timber during the storm was surprising. After it abated I continued on my journey but found it very difficult travelling in many places the road being blocked up by the falling of timber. I reached Wilksbarree on Wednesday. It appears that the storm extended through the country and at the same hour of the day blew more violent in some places than others. At Exeeter about nine miles from Wilksbarrie a level plain loaded with pitch pine timber was swept of its timber; scarce a tree left for more than a mile in length and three fourths of a mile wide being either torn up by the roots or twisted off leaving their stumps from 5 to 30 feet high.A number of buildings in different parts of the country stript of their roofs and otherways damaged–fences in many place removed and many fields of corn others grain and flax laid level with the earth–cattle killed by the falling of timber in every part of the country.A Mr. –Lot who lived at Mahooper about 35 miles from Wilksbarre whose family consisted of his wife and a number of children– he with his wife being absent children seeing themselves in danger in the house left it at the instant a large tree was falling; the tree reached them a small distance from the door and a girl about eleven years of age was crushed to pieces about expired instantly. One of the other children had a thigh and both arms broke another badly wounded in the head–these two it is feared has received the fatal blow two other slightly wounded.Extract of a letter from Richmond Virginia dated July 28.By accounts from Kentucky we are informed that about the 1st of this month a party of Indians appeared near Frankfort and took a great number of horses and negroes. Col. M'Dowell with 300 men pursued them to the Ohio; but not falling in with them he crossed the river leaving 100 men to take care of his horses; after marching about 12 or 15 miles overtook a large party when a severe engagement ensued but being overpowered by numbers was obliged to retreat. He then sent for the men left behind and came up with the Indians the next day and after engaging some time obliged them to make a precipitate retreat. Col. M'Dowell took six Indian warriors two Englishmen and a Frenchman from Detroit and all the negroes and horses.Newtown June 27.On the 13th instant the meeting house in Newtown was removed about eight rods the removal was effected in one hour and an half after previous preparations for the purpose had been made.

They had been met at Niagara by Indian commissioners and with them had sailed in separate vessels to the mouth of Detroit river 18 miles from Detroit where our commissioners were directed to remain until an asswer should be brought from the great council of Indian nations assembled at the rapids of the Miami and the Lake. On the 2d of August an answer was brought to this effect that the only terms onw hich peace could be made was our ceding the country on the west of the Ohio and Allegheny rivers. The commissioners suggested the impossibilities of doing this as the lands had been sold by the Congress and people had settled on them but that the United States would be willing to give more goods than they had given at any other time. The Indians replied that if the Congress would give one half these goods to the people that had settled the would leave the land and remove the difficulty. Our commissioners replied that the land they must have and would not give it up. The Indians said it was well and there need no more be said. However desired them to remain if they thought proper until they returned to the council and laid this before them. On the 16th of August two Indians came and informed that the final result of their deliberations was the country in question or war. The express is of opinion from the language of individual Indians in private and from other circumstances that the British wholly conduct their council and dictate their demands.By the arrival of some person from Fort Washington on Monday last we are informed that the Indians still contiue hovering about our garrisons and occasionally stealing horses that the army is in high spirits anxiously waiting the event of the treaty and hoping that a campaign will take place as no idea of peace is entertained by any one; that the greatest pains has been taken by the commander in chief in training his men in the act wood fighting and that from their proficiency and the ???imity prevailing throughout the whole army success may be expected should a campaign take place.New York Sept. 17.A Mr. Spier was removed from his lodgings in this city on Sunday last to Governors Island where he died this morning. He arrived from Philadelphia last Thursday was seized with Fever on Friday.–The Doctors pronounced it the malignant putrid fever and the event proved their opinion to be just.According to a list published of the births and deaths in the several religious societies of Philadelphia it appears that from August 1 1792 to August 1 1793 the Births amounted to 2511 and the Death to 1467.Philadelphia Sept. 21.The stages for New-York returned to this city with all the passengers (mortified and fatigued.) One of the drivers had a very narrow escape with his life being cruelly fired upon at Trenton; the ball passing within a few inches of his head! The ladies &. have been without any refreshment on the road as the panic and terror with which every mind is possessed by the writings and measures above alluded to prevented their obtaining any accommodations on the road–O tell it not in Gath! declare it not in the streets of Askelon! Ye New Yorkers and ye Baltimorians you have been generous to strangers; but forgot the charitable and fraternal attention due to your own fellow-citizens!Sept. 25.Extract of a letter from a gentleman who lately left his city on his way to the southward.We were stopped about seven miles from Baltimore by armed men who used us with every indignity and hatred truly indicative of malice prepense. These detained us in the stage from five to the afternoon until ten the ensuing morning; during this interval one of these ruffians who appeared to be a German snapped his piece at one of this party who seemed inclined to leave the stage with an apparent design to go among the bushes nears the road; this guard in their tender mercy wre pleased to hand us a piece of dry cheese on the end of a pitch-fork. After this quarantine we were permitted to go to Gray's Garden and there to perform another for the space of two days and nights.New-York Sept. 28.Extract of a letter from Philadelphia to a gentleman in Baltimore dated the 20th instant.You request I would endeavour to give you a particular account of the state of the city in general and the rise and progress of the malignant fever now raging here.I believe it will be difficult precisely to determine its origin; but it is generally admitted to have been imported from Cape-Francois in a vessel which came to a wharf betwen Arch and Race-street beause the infection broke out ina house connected with that vessel and it was afterwards traced to that vessel. The disorder overtook several families thereabouts. But most people apprehended it to be the general fall-fever which acted severly on those who had the influenza–To that there was no material danger apprehended until the death of Peter Ashton in Vine-street who after a short illness died about one month past; after which the disorder was clearly discovered to be the putrid or yellow fever and each person became after of his neighbours insomuch that if any became sick they were avoided and many fled from the sick leaving them in a destitute situation perhaps shut up in a house and the neighbours alarmed merchants and housekeepers moved into the country and fear was stamped on every countenance–infirmness possessed the hearts of the people–little business was done except packing up–engaging waggons to move goods into the country and searching for shelter for their families; many families set off without having a particular place to go to. Thus the country became alarmed. Individuals died in the country–but I cannot learn ?hat it spread there.The overseers duty became exceedingly heavy and several of them were taken sick; others abandoned their post and the business bore very hard on the remaining few. Finding deaths increasingly abundantly they procured carpenters to make coarse coffins by the do???. The malady still increasing in Water Front Race and Vine-street threatened desolation in those quarters. The overseers moved by the distresses of the helpless took possession of Bush-Hill mansion (it being empty) and erected a hospital employed some physicians and nurses; sent out some accomadations and provided for interring the dead.The overseers became inadequate to the business by reason fo fear; few in number and the funds exhausted; added to this the extravagant wages of the nurses two and three dollars per day most of the magistrates fled; the house of employment and hospital shut their doors against all indigent and indisposed persons. Thus were the people who had been private patientes on the poor list abandoned and had no sheltering place and those who were slightly indisposed were sent to Bush-Hill and became victims with many others.The inhabitants were requested to meet by public advertisement and a committee of 40 was appointed to take charge of the Bush-Hill hospital and to relieve the distressed in the city and its vicinity they became organized Ianto693 negociated a loan in the bank two of the number voluntarily offered their service to see the business of Bush-Hill properly conducted; bedsteads were procured the house cleaned matrons appointed and nurses under their direction; an apothecary with medicine &c. and four physicians to attend once a day.The remainder of the committee attend at the State House receive information from the committee at Bush-Hill and supply their demands; receive all sheets shirts &c. &c. at the State-House also keep a supply of ready made coffins to furnish as occasion required. Several carts are procured for the various purposes of carrying out the sick whom the doctors pronounce to have the fever of disposing the corpsand for carrying provisions and other necessaries to and from the hospital. THere is also a house fitted up and under the care of a matron to be for the use of those children whose parents have died with the fever; as all their relations and neighbours are shy of them; the governor has directed the State Treasury to be open for their use and they to be accountable to him for their expenditures.–The city seems quite solitary and business at a stand; deaths numerous and no parade at the interment of any; the bells do not ring nor is there any invitations to the funeral of any. I think about 1000 have died since the disorder first made its appearance but it cannot be ascertained with precision; and we think between 15 and 20000 removed from their habitations.The doctors suppose the disorder a little checked by the cool weather; how that is I know now.By a passenger arrived from Albany this morning we learn that in order to prevent the introduction of the Yellow Fever in Albany they have formed Committees and fixed a Gun-Boat at some distance from the city where all vessels are stopt till the Doctors examine the passengers–And that Colonel Hamilton and Lady were arrived but were denied admittance into the city and had taken lodgings at a Mr. M'Gown's at Green-Bush.October 2.Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Philadelphia to the Printers of this PAper dated September 28.The papers must have amply informed you of the melancholy situation of this city for five or six weeks past. Grave digging has been the only business carrying on; and ndeed I may say of late Pit digging where people are interred indiscriminately in three tiers of coffins. From the most accurate observations I can make upon matters I think I speak within bounds when I Say eighteen hundred persons have perished (I do not say all of the yellow fever) since its first appearance on the 3d of August in North Water-street; others think a larger number–but I confess we are a good deal in the dark on the subject at present and it will take some time to have accurate returns made.People have been hitherto so panic struck that little has been attnded to but the means of self-preservation; gloom and melancholy is on every persons countenance; nothing but the yellow fever is talked of; the street are often seen without a passenger; the wharfs are deserted the markets miserable and uncommonly high and nearly one half the citizens departed. The city is truly republican; pomp and distinction have in a great measure disadpeared and bad Plato himself come among us to preach up the practice of true republicansim his lectures could not have had a greater effect upon the minds of men than the present mortality.We make use of no other precaution for avoiding the contagion than not going into infected houses–keeping our own well aired clean and frequently having the walls white-washed. considering the general terro I have more than once felt my pulse to discover whether I was really alive or not; however I now begin to hoep we may escape as cool weather is fast approaching and one-street in general healthy.Of all things this yellow fever is the most insidious–its approaches are generally gradual–a person imagines himself well when he is dying–other loss the use of reason entirely and die in that situations. with those few that recover its effects are long left. It acts like a steeltrap–when once it gets hold of a person it does not easily let him get off.Philadelphia Oct. 7.Died of Sunday the 29th ult. Samuel Powell Esq.
