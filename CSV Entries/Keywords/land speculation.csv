It is not easy to make money by farming at present in the United States for the want of a market; and I am of opinion that things will not mend in this respect for some years for all are sellers and none buyers. All kinds of produce are selling or rather offered for sale at one-third of what prices were two years ago. Land of course has fallen in the same ratio. The best of cleared land within from 5 to 10 miles of this town is offered for them from 10 to 20 dollars an acre. You will thence conclude that this is a favourable time to purchase – and that for a man who has a little money and a large family able and willing to labour with their hands this is a most excellent country as he can easily raise on this cheap land all the necessaries and many of the luxuries of life. He will find it difficult to get gold or silver or even our own bad bank notes; but a man cannot be badly off with more beef mutton pork and grain than he can dispose of. He has no rent to make up by term day: his taxes are next to nothing and although he may grumble to have to turn his pigs into his corn field to save the expense of reaping it or to see his apples rotting under his trees by barn-fulls because he has not room or use for them yet still these are beatable distresses compared to those of the poor farmers in our native land and as I suppose in England. To the wealthier farmer the change is not beneficial or desirable. It is true that if he stays long in Britain he will soon become less wealthy; yet still he would for some time regret the change. He would miss many things made necessary by habit; he would find his servants more lazy and less obedient ; and he would even experience pain because the modes of farming he is accustomed to will not do here; but when he gets over these things he will find the advantage of the change. To say nothing of the difference of the Government and the satisfaction of chusing one's own rulers there are many desirable things here. I estimate as the greatest the ease of providing for one's family. A man may with very little exertion leave to all his children land enough to make them independent. Hence that sickening anxiety about the future fate of a family is little known here.  ID269,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1837,07,09,inform,Highland Emigrants. –The ship Midlothian has just been fitted up at Leith for the reception of Highland emigrants which she is to take in at the Isle of Skye for Sydney New South Wales. These emigrants are we believw to be carried out at a very small cost to themselves the largest portion of the passage money being paid by Government out of the land revenue of New South Wales which is exclusively appropriated towards the encouragement and promotion of emigration–the objects in view being as well the relief of those districts in this country which are suffering from the want of employment and subsistence as by the introduction into that colony of a body of well disposed and virtuous free emigrant families and individuals the promotion of the moral welfare of the colonists generally. The emigrants will we believe receive employment in New South Wales as farm-servants shepherds overseers &c. We had a brief inspection of the Midlothian on Monday afternoon and found it to be a very fine vessel fitted up in a manner the most comfortable and convenient that could well be effected. She sails this afternoon from Leith to the Isle of Skye.  ID276,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1839,04,03,inform,Colonel Wyndham has sent out a commission to Canada to purchase an estate of 10000 acres and intends furnishing the same assistance to persons desirous of emigrating from his estates to Australia and Canada as was given by the late Earl of Egremont.– Morning Herald.  ID277,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1839,05,11,inform,New Zealand. –A vessel selected to carry out emigrants to New Zealand under the auspices of a company formed in this country will sail in about a fortnight. She is called the Tory and measures about 480 tons. A dejeuner was given on Saturday by the proprietors on board in the West India Docks at which Lord Durham Lord Petre Sir G. Sinclair and several other distinguished persons were present. She is a fine vessel well armed and ample preparations have been made for the voyage. The company have purchased 600000 acres of land from the native chiefs.  ID346,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,10,04,inform,Extract of a letter from Philadelphia July 22. Trade is brisk at present from the high prices and great sales of grain to Europe. Our farmers and giving above 6 s. currency (about 3s. sterling) to workmen per day and their meat to enable them to take in new grounds which is a great discouragement to our rising manufactories which are obliged to give high wages to their journeymen on that account. A Mr. Doylden from Europe has lately purchased two millions of acres of lands from Congress Mr. Scriba merchant in New York has purchased four millions of acres all from Congress a society of gentlemen with whom it is said some Dutch houses in Amsterdam are concerned have purchased from the State of Georgia about fifteen millions of land on the frontiers of that State. The very highest price paid for any of these purchases has been twenty cents per acre (about ten-pence British money) payable by installments at different periods and that in Congress money.  ID368,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,07,25,advertise,LANDS in AMERICA for SALE. THESE two adjoining TRACKS of LAND in the County of FAYETTE and State of KENTUCKY. The one track consists of 7000 acres and is divided into 15 plantations of 500 acres each; eight of these plantations are still unsold and are now offered at the low price of 137l. being only 5s. 6d. per acre. The other track counsists of 3086 acres and is to be sold in one lot at 5s. 6d. per acre. There is a fine stream of water running through these two tracks of land which communicates with the great river Ohio so that Mills may be erect. In Fayette County is Lexington where the Courts of the State of Kentucky are held and where all public business is transacted Lexington is in the neighbourhood of these lands and Fayette county is the nearest and most convenient for Philadelphia Baltimore City of Washington &c. The soil of Kentucky is deep and black and lies upon a bed of lime-stone and coal. THe natural grown of the country are large walnuts honey poplar and sugar trees. The surface is covered with blue grass clover and wild rye grape vines running to the tops of the trees. Shrubs and plants grow spontaneously and afford a beautiful blossom of a rich and exquisite fragrance. Cotton and sugar are manufactured to advantage. wheat barley oats flax and hemp yield abundantly; indeed it is assumed that there have been raised 100 bushels upon one acre but the common produce is from 40 to 60 bushels an acre. Owing to the peculiar richness of the soil and fine climate of the country no part of America has been to repidly settled. The returns made to Congress upon 1st May 1792 state them at 76 000. In March 1793 there were upwards of 100000. And from their astonishing increase since they may be estimated at 200000.
