Sydney cove named so in honour of Lord Sydney the Governor chose in preference which is about hal a mile in length and a quarter of a mile across at the entrance. Here was the finest spring water and ships can anchor so close in short that at a very small expence quays may be constructed at which the largest vessels may constantly unload. His meeting with the natives here was friendly and uninterrupted. The appearance of the place was picturesque and pleasing and it afforded an ample harvest for botanical acquisitions.
