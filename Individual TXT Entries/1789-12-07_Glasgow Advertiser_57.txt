Extract of a letter from a Gentleman at CharlesTown, South Carolina, September  2, 1789, to  a friend in Bristol. "My inclination has taken such a stubborn longing after your side of the water, that I cannot enjoy tranquility here. So very wretched have I been at times, that I can hardly support the regret I feel, that I ever changed the bright and alluring varieties of cultivation England, for the dreary the desolate scenes of America."Happy are those who have quitted this land of misery ; and I belive a situation here is not found enviable by the greatest patriots in the State. They are all in the secret, sighing for the comforts of Old England. A bare pittance there, would be preferable to the largest possessions here."
