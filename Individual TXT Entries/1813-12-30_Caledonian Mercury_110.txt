Victory in CanadaBy the Dunlop, Captain Abrams, arrived on Sunday last, at Greenock, from Quebec, after a passage of 36 days, papers and letters have been received from Canada, to the 19th, which contain an amount of an engagement between a detachment of the British force under Lieut.-Col. Morrison, consisting of the 49th[?] and 89th regiments, with some companies of the Canadian militia, and a body of American troops, amounting to 4000 men, which ended in the defeat of the latter, with great loss. This action was produced by the attempt of the American General to advance to Montreal, from which it appears, however, he has now begun to measure back his steps, having crossed to the American side of the river where the action was fought, and being actively pursued in his retreat by the British troops.The following information has been received by the Alexander, Captain Henry, which arrived at Liverpool on Tuesday:–"Quebec, Nov. 26. 1813 "The enemy's whole force was about 8000 men, under the command of General Wilkinson. The division commanded by General Boyd, consisting of about 3000 to 4000 infantry, cavalry &c. was alone engaged upon the 11th instant."The enemy lost in the action, Brigadier Gen. Conington and Colonel Preston, killed–probably 600 men killed, wounded, and taken."The consequence was a precipitate retreat across the St Lawrence at Cornwall on the 13th, and evacuating the province. General Wilkinson marched his troops into the Straits, the route of Plattsburgh, leaving all his boats, upwards of 300, in the Salmon river, where they were frozen in on the 16th, and 2000 men to protect them."Colonel Plenderleath came home in the Alexander, with dispatches.
