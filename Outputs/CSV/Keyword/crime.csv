Yesterday were executed William Donnoffee William Smith and Rachel Wall pursuant to their sentence for highway robbery.  ID76,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,22,entertain,On Tuesday afternoon the six Cherokee Chiefs visited the Cathedral of St. Paul's which they explain with an equal degree of curiosity and amazement. They were asked whether they would not attend the evening service which they readily complied and seemed particularly delighted with the organ. The Cherokee Chiefs having made us an offer of 20000 men gratitude obliges us to make them some acknowledgement whether we accept their offer or not.–We can very well spare them the members of the Halter Club–all our housebreakers highwaymen pick pockets swindlers Faro and E O Table keepers–and all their accomplices to an amazing number. Such a collection would be a truly valuable present.–Among them are found dispersedly all the qualities of able Generals–skilful Financiers –able Negotiators active Citizens–and men highly expert at a Coup de Main. Were we to add the Pugilistic tribe–the Cherokee Chiefs might on their return to their own country enter into a boxing war against their enemies–with a certainty of the most brilliant success. Trading Justices and Lawyers they would perhaps be glad to have ; and it is the opinion of most people that a few thousands of the latter description of men might be spared.  ID91,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,08,06,inform,One of the recent circumstances that have occupied the attention of the judicial power at Botany Bay was the removal of one of the free female convicts from Sidney Cove for keeping a house of ill-fame.  ID103,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1810,06,09,inform,Canada Extract of a letter from a Gentleman to his Friend in Glasgow Quebec March 23 1810.–A number of leading characters among the Canadians who were Members of the House of Assembly (twice dissolved for improper conduct) and the proprietor of a French paper called La Canadien have been arrested and thrown into jail upon a charge of treasonable and seditious practises ; the printing press types &c. also taken possession of. This vigorous measure of Sir James Craig has astonished the Canadians not a little but the consequences will be no doubt beneficial to the country as it has crushed a faction which has for some years been gaining strength and acquiring dangerous influence over the minds of the inhabitants who are without education and ignorant of course in the extreme ; therefore easily misled by demagogues among their countrymen who seize every opportunity of stirring up all those prejudices which the people of this country naturally have against the British : for having been allowed to preserve their language they are nearly as much Frenchmen now as they were at the conquest. Quebec March 22.–On Sunday afternoon the printer of the Canadien Mr Charles Lafrancois was arrested and committed to jail under a warrant from the Executive Council on a charge of treasonable practises. On Monday evening Dr Blanchet and Mr Bedard and last evening Mr T. Taschereau were also arrested and committed by the same authority on the same charges. The Commander in Chief in Scotland gave an elegant dinner at head-quarters on the 4th curt. to celebrate the King's birthday-day–at which several of the Nobility and Gentry Generals and Field-Officers of the army were present. Among the other accidents that occurred on the King's birth-day from the imprudent use of gunpowder is the death of girl in Richmond Street.– Her clothes were set fire by a squib and although immediately taken to the Infirmary was so severely burnt that she died before morning. A very melancholy accident happened at a place called the Pease Berwickshire. As one of the baggage carts of the Forfarshire militia was stopping there a fine boy about eight years of age belonging to Serjeant-Major Nicol got out of the cart and was climbing on the wheel when the horses suddengoing off threw him on the ground and the wheel passing over his body crushed him to death. The unfortunate mother was upon the cart when this unhappy accident happened. On Thursday night a spirit shop in Gibson-street Glasgow was broken into and about five pounds in silver a seven shilling piece about eight shillings of copper a counterfeit half-guinea and a pocket-book containing some bills and papers carried ; some partial payments are marked on the bills. The villains appear to have entered the shop by forcing up the window shutter with an iron bar and then breaking a pane of glass by which they got the iron bolts and the window opened. On Saturday last a porter was killed in the hold of a vessel in Dundee harbour. He was engaged unloading coals ; and the rope by which the iron pully was supported giving way the measure fell down upon him and killed him instantly. A few days ago a mason of the name of Stevenson was killed by the blowing up of some stones at Templeton in the parish of Auchterhouse. The match unfortunately communicated too early to the powder and the explosion took place before he could get out of the way. He has left a wife and two children to lament his loss.  ID112,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1814,05,26,inform,A proclamation issued by Governor Macquarrie appears in the Sidney Gazette of 14th May stating that Peter Mills Acting Deputy Surveyor of Lands at Port Dalrymple Van Dieman's Land and George Williams Acting Deputy Commissary of Stores and provisions at the said settlement had absconded from their habitations and fled to the woods ; that their object was to live by rapine and violence ; to effect which they had armed themselves and taken the command of a gang of 26 desperadoes with whose aid they had committed numerous robberies–entering the lands of settlers driving away their cattle and plundering their houses. The proclamation declares that those who shall return to their houses and occupations before 1st December next shall be pardoned and saved harmless from all offences except the crime of wilful murder ; and denounces those who shall disregard this offer as outlaws. Sydney New South Wales Jan. 4. The Argo has arrived with a most extensive supply of tea viz 167 chests of souchong 200 ditto bobea 200 hyson skin and young hyson 50 ; in all 617 chests. The consequences has been a reduction in the price of souching from 30s to 5s per lb currency. Shortly prior to the Argo's departure from the Island of Mauritius the Hope American ship laden with tea and sundies valued at L80000 was captured by his Majesty's sloop Harpy Captain Allen. In consequences of the oppressive conduct of several masters of colonial and British ships and of their crews towards the natives of New Zealand of Otaheite and of the other islands in the South Pacific Ocean which have led to the destruction of several vessels with their crews by the natives and disturbed all trade and intercourse with those islands both by British shipping and that ofthe allied powers–his Excellency has forbidden any vessel to clear out from any place in New South Wales without a bond given by the master or owner to the naval officer for the time being at the port for L.1000 sterling binding him and his crew not to commit any act of hostility or to be guilty of any trespass or forment any animosities between the natives or take any part in any war that may prevail ; nor forcibly carry away any male or female inhabitants of the islands under penalty of forfeiting the sum specified in the bond. A small party who a short time ago undertook[?] a land passage in a direction towards Broken Bay for the purpose of ascertaining the nature and fertility of the country have discovered an excellent grazing track of 8000acres. In consequence of which one gentlemen Mr Robert Campbell has already sent thither an extensive herd of cattle and this example is likely to be followed by others. Thomas West who came to this colony a convict for life in the ship Earl Cornwall's[?] in 1801 has received from his Excellency a conditional pardon in consideration of his general good conduct and character for sobriety and industry and also in consideration of his having lately erected a water mill for the grinding of grain at Barcorn Glen within two miles of Sydney being the first water mill ever erected in the vicinty of this town. Sydney New South Wales May 21. The good understanding between the natives and our settlers which had been maintained for the last six years has given place to frequent outrages attended with fatal consequences. On Saturday a body of 60 natives commenced plundering the fields of a settler when three privates of the veteran battalion fired upon them and killed a boy. The narushed upon them before they could load again and killed on private Isaac Eustace and compelled the other two to fly. They then plundered the ground of Messrs Milehouse and Butcher. Next day a party of 14 soldiers falling in with them shot a woman and two children–the savages attacked William Baker a stock-keeper of Mr MacArthur killed the man and two women named Sullivan and Herburg. Sydney New South Wales Feb. 12. On Monday last arrived the ship General Hewett Captain Earle from England having a detachment of the 46th regiment commanded by Major Oglivie ; and yesterday arrived the Windham Captain Bligh also from England having on board the head-quarters of the 46th regiment commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Molle who succeeded Lieutenant-Colonel O'Connell as Lieutenant-Governor of the territory and is accompanied by Mrs Molle and family ; also Lieutenant Walters of the navy agent for transports– Of the 300 convicts which the General Hewett received on board 35 died on the passage.  ID124,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,19,inform,New York and other American papers have been received to the 20th December: – In the house of Representatives on the 9th Mr Johnson brought forward a series of resolutions relative to the military establish the principal of which is the following: – That the military peace establishment of the United States shall consist hereafter of eight thousand men including the corps of invalids. Provided that the corps of engineers the General Staff and Ordnance Department shall be retained as at present established. Provided also that no part of the army shall be disbanded in consequence of said reduction but the same shall be effected by permitting vacancies as they occur to remain – That it is expedient to provide by law for an additional national armoury to be located on the western waters. That it is expedient to organise by law a corps of invalids to be composed of one thousand men. The following resolution relative to foreign seamen was also proposed and adopted without opposition : Resolved. That the Committee of Commerce and Manufactures be instructed to inquire into the expediency of providing by law for the apprehending and securing foreign seamen deserting from foreign vessels while in the ports of the United States contrary to their engagements to serve on board such vessels.  ID128,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,07,04,inform,American Papers From the Trenton Federalist June 8 The seizure trial and execution of two men said to be British subjects by our military folks who lately invaded the Spanish Territory seems to be confirmed by accounts from the south with a lament added thereto that another of the same nation had not been catched and killed. If these accounts should prove true I think the President will as good reason for recommending to Congress at the next session the abolition of the army as he had at the last for doing away the naval forces on the lakes– because it was more likely to involve us in war than to give us security and peace. A little while ago we made quite a bluster and noise because the King of Spain had imprisoned one of our citizens at Cadiz; but the nation seems to rest very easy at present with the above named executions. Why?–because the wrong is committed by us not against us. Extract of a letter dated Washington city June 2. 1818:– The British Consul-General A. St. John Baker is about to depart for Europe; the ostensible cause of his departure is the recovery of his health but it is sufficient to look in his face to see that it is only a common diplomatic disease which may be aggravated or cured at discretion ; the real object is diplomatic ; the English Cabinet has expressed some hesitation in regard to certain subjects in Mr Bagot's dispatches ; the speculation carrying on between the Spanish agents and some persons in this place opens a field of corruption so wide and comprehensive. Mr Baker goes prepared to state the facts from his immediate knowledge ; for no man is better acquainted with men and things here.– The Chevalier Colonel Sarmiento is also preparing to visit Madrid but his business appears to relate to mercantile affairs of some Americans on the west coast ; he received 27000 dollars for one service of this king but the object for which he received the douceur failed and he will not refund. Treasury Department. Washington May 25 1818. SIR–The act of Congress concerning navigation hereto annexed which is to take effect the first day of October next so materially changes the commerce of the United States with the colonies and territories of Britannic Majesty thata due regard to the convenience and interest of those engaged in it requires that the construction of the act should at this time be determined. According to the term used un ther the first section of the act every port or place in the British colonies and territories in the West Indies and on the continent of America must be considered as closed against vessels of the United States to which they are not by act of Parliament permitted to carry on the same trade both in exports and imports which is now or shall be carried on in British vessels between the ports of the United States and the ports of any British colony or territory. The permissions by act of Parliament to vessels of the United States to go in ballast to Turk's Island and bring away salt or to carry certain articles to one or more of the Bahama Islands and bring away salt and a few other articles cannot be considered as opening the ports of those islands to the vessels of the United States according to the intention of the act of Congress whilst British vessels are permitted to carry on the same trade in articles prohibited to vessels of the United States. It may be proper to observe that the prohibition in the first section applies equally to vessels whether in ballast or with cargoes. The form of the bond required by the second section of the act is hereunto annexed. It is expected that proper circumspection will be exercised in requiring a security as much of the efficacy of the act will depend upon the judicious discharge of this part of your duty. I am very respectfully Sir your most obedient servant Wm. H. Crawford. Collector of the Port of Alexandria D.C. From the Philadelphia Gazette. Extract of a Letter dated Laguira May 11. General Morillo has obtained a victory at Coxeder eleven leagues from St Carlos over Paez who had under his command about 1500 cavalry and 600 or 800 infantry out of which 1000 men were killed and 400 horses and three stand of colours taken. The Spaniards lost 100 in killed and wounded. This took place on the 2d instant. Extract of a letter dated from St Thomas 26th May. We have the official news here from Caraccas that another battle had been fought on the 11th instant about 20 leagues west from San Carlos in which both parties seem to have fought with desperation. The Spaniards say that the Patriots are totally defeated but acknowledge the loss of many first rate officers. The Commander in Chief of the Royal army engaged (De La Torre) is severely wounded and his Aid-deCamp (Colonel Villars) and about 20 officers killed and wounded. It is said that the pass (Calabosa) is again in the hands of the Royalists. The Royal Commander in Chief (Morillo) has  ID129,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,09,05,inform,Canada The inhabitants of Upper Canada have had another meeting under the title of a Convention at York ; when they came to the following resolutions ; Richard Beasely Esq. in the chair :– Resolved–1. That whilst this Convention holds it one one of the most sacred right of British subjects at all times directly to petition the throne of their Sovereign relative to their grievances yet nevertheless under the present peculiar existing circumstances of this country the Members of this Convention as well out of respect to that Honourable Body the Commons House of Assembly of Upper Canada as for other causes deem it their indispensable duty on this important occasion to recommend in the strongest terms to their fellow subjects resident in this province a spirit formal and respectful application to that Honourable House for an inquiry into the state of the province. 2. That John Clarke Cyrus Sumner and Roderick Drake Esqs. be a permanent Committee for the management of the affairs of the Convention and that they as soon as may be practicable prepare a respectful petition praying for inquiring and expressive of grievances (for the sanction of this Convention) to be by them circulated for subscribers and presented at the bar of the House of Assembly at their next meeting session. That the said Committee be further authorised to frame and Address to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent on the subject of grievances believed to exist in Upper Canada which when approved of by the Convention shall be submitted by the Committee together with the petition above mentioned to the Honourable House of Assembly at their next meeting for their alterationg and amendment. Mr Gourlay who has had so instrumental a hand in instigating these proceedings is stated to have been arrested and held to bail at Kingston for distributing a printed account of the state of grievances of the people of the Niagara district ; and this by direction of the AttorneyGeneral of the province who is reported to have influenced the Justice who signed the warrant by certain threats of vengeance if he refused. Another report is mentioned as being in circulation namely that official instruction have been sent to particular Magistrates to take notice of and transmit to Government the names of all persons holding commissions civil or military who engage in the measures of petitioning the Prince Regent as recommended by Mr Gourlay in order that they may be removed from their offices. The Upper Canada Convention met at York on the 6th inst. under the Presidency of Richard Bearly Esq. J. P. It has styled itself a Convention of Friends to Free Inquiry and resolved to change the proposed plan of sending deputies to England with a petition to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent confining itself to an application to the House of Assembly for an inquiry into the state of the province and a petition to his Royal Highness to be presented to Sir Peregrine Maitland for transmission.– From the Quebec Gazette of July 31.  ID308,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1841,12,29,inform,Theatre Royal. –The Pantomine we observe is postponed till Friday. Meanwhile the theatre is crowded nightly the public being admitted at second price from the commencement of the performances. Music Hall. –We stated about two month ago that in connection with other improvements in the Assembly Rooms a plan was under consideration for erecting a Music Hall. We are now happy to announce that at a meeting of the proprietors of the Rooms last week full pwers were given to the Directors to take the requisite steps for carrying the design into execution. The desire so long felt by the cultivators of music here will soon be realisd by the erection of a splendid hall constructed with a due regard to the accommodation both of professional men and the public and with a minute attention to the most recent improvements by which full effect is secured to musical performances when conducted on a grand scale. By what may be called a propitious coincidence Mr Bishop the new Professor of Music arrived in Edinburgh on the very day when this resolution was come to. Martin's Paintings. –The exhibition of these celebrated paintings in this city has already we believe attracted many visitors. They are truly wonderful creations and possess a power and grandeur of which the engravings so familiar to the public convey but a faint conception. In contemplating the Deluge the spectator is so [?] [?] [?] the scene that he is apt to overlook the details; but these will be found on inspection to be among the most interesting features of the picture. The groups of perishing beings are exquisitely wrought while everything is made to contribute to the terrific grandeur of the catastrophe. The other two pictures–Pandemonium and the Rivers of Bliss are smaller in size but equally indicative of the high poetic genius of the artist. Nothing could be more striking than the contrast these pictures present to each other–the one fearful beyond expression the other exhibiting a heavenly serenity and loveliness on which the eye rests with delight. There are several other valuable paintings in this collection amongst which is The Offering Up of Isaac a Rembrandt in fine preservation. Gordon's British Diorama. –This beautiful exhibition opened on Saturday last and has we understand been crowded with visitors ever since. It will be seen by Mr Gordon's advertisement in to-day's paper that the view of the Tower of London during the recent conflagration (to which we alluded in our last) has now arrived and is being exhibited along with the other views. Broughton-place Congregation.–We understand that the call given by BroughtonPlace Congregation to the Rev. Mr Croon Sanquhar to be colleague to the Rev. Dr. Brown has not been accepted owing to the strong claims which the affectionate people among whom he presently labours have to continuance of his services and his unfitness as he alleges for a charge so laborious; a result which we learn has caused among the members of Broughton-Place extreme and general regret. Cooke's Equestrian Amphitheatre Leith. –Mr Cooke has generously handed over to the Provost for the benefit of the Destitute Sick Society the handsome sum of t15; being the free proceeds of Friday evening's entertainment which took place under the patronage of the Provost and Magistrates. Captain Ross' Discoveries. –Extracts from Captain Ross' despatches have been published in a Parliamentary paper. From the map which accompanies the paper we gain a more distinct idea of his track than the previous article copied from the Athenean[?] afforded. South Victoria Land which he discovered extends in latitude from 70 1/2 south to 79 how much farther is unknown; and in longitude its eastern coast lies between 163 and 171. Its position is directly south from New Zealand and at the distance of 1500 geographical miles. The length of the part seen was fully 500 miles. It was girt with a border of ice many miles in breadth which rendered it inaccessible. The passage southward was closed at latitude 78 by a barrier of ice 150 feet high which was traced for 300 miles east from Victoria Land. Icebergs were encountered in numbers after they passed parallel of 63 and pack ice at 66. The land rose in lofy peaks from 9000 to 12000 feet in height perfectly covered with eternal snow; the glaciers descended from near the mountain summits project many miles into the ocean and presented a perpendicular face of lofty cliffs. They could not reach the mainland but landed on an island which they found to consist of volcanic rocks. On 28th January in latitude 77 1/2 longitude 169 E. they discovered a magnificent volcano emitting smoke and flame in a splendid profusion and named it Mount Erebus. An extinct one near it was named after the other vessel Mount Terror. At the distance of less than half a mile from the ice cliffs which barred their progress southward they had sound ings with 318 fathoms. These cliffs no doubt reached the bottom and including the 150 feet above water must have had an elevation fo 2000 feet of thereabout. The observations on the dip and declination induced them to place the South Magnetic Pole in latitude 76 and east longitude 153; and they considered its position as well ascertained as if they had reached it though their nearest approach to it was a point 160 miles from it on the east coast of Victoria Land. The pole is probably within that region though this cannot be positively affirmed as its western boundary is unknown. The highest latitude they reached 78. 4. They were therefore only 12 degrees from the pole and about 4 degrees nearer to it than Captain Weddel[?] the most successful of their predecessors. The Non-intrusion Disclosures. –In the Advertiser of yesterday there is a letter from J. M. Hog Esq. of Newliston and another from the Rev. Dr Simpson of Kirknewton both expressing their extreme surprise at the letter of Mr Hamilton (which appeared in our last) and strongly disclaiming all connexion with it on the part of the General Assembly's Committee. Sabbath Observance–The Sweetie Case. –We understand that the Government of Prussia thinking that the mode of keeping the Sabbath in that country was in some respects too lax recently sent over a person to this country to learn whether our practise in Britain would not furnish hints for improvement. Unluckily the very first specimens of our piety which met him were the sweetie case and that of the poor man Key who was excommunicated for burying his child on Sunday. These will of course figure in the very front of the officer's report as the natural fruits of our system and we may guess what their effect will be in reconciling the Germans to a stricter observance of Sunday! We can moreover inform Butters' prosecutors that the fame of their exploits has already travelled by the aid of the Teutonic newspapers to the uttermost parts of Germany to the infinite amusement of the Swabian farmers the Saxon miners and the shepherds of the Riesengeberge. Key's case is no doubt destined to enjoy equal celebrity. Airdrie–Anti-Corn-Law Conference. – On Monday last the members of the United Secession Church Airdrie favourable to a repeal of the Corn and Provision Laws met in compliance with the request of the Committee taking the active management of the Conference to be held in Edinburgh on the second week in January next on that subject when they unanimously appointed their pastor the Rev. Matthew M'Gavin A.M. Mr John Craig Waddell proprietor and Mr James Forrester merchant in Airdrie to represent their sentiments at that meeting which is looked forward to with great interest by the liberal portion of the inhabitants of the burgh. The Rev. Mr Taylor with Messrs Adam Nimmo contractor and John Young bookseller will represent the Independent congregation; and Mr Thomas Muir pastor of the Baptist church will represent that body on that occasion. Kirkcudbright–Address to the Dean of Faculty –We learn that at a meeting held on the 17th current of the Clerks and Procurators of the Steward and COmmissary Courts an address was voted to Alexander Wood Esq. on his appointment to the office of Dean of Faculty and his retirement from that of Steward of Kirkcudbright. Distress in Paisley. –We understand that the Bookbinders of Edinburgh purpose to give a Grand Musical Melange in a few days the proceeds of which are to be handed over to the committee for the distressed weavers in Paisley. Musselburgh. –Mr Wilson Treasurer to the Honest Town has by the hands of the district committeesm collected from the contributors to the Prince of Wales fund nearly t100; and the committees have already distributed 130 tons of coals to the necessitous families in the neighbourhood. Presbytery of Dalkeith–Case of Mr Monroe. –This Presbytery met on Tuesday the 21st current. At a former meeting an agent appeared for Mr Monroe presentee to Fala and laid on the table of Presbytery a presentation in his favour to the parish of Fala. It having been objected that the presentation and some other papers relative thereton bore that Mr Monroe was presented merely to the parish of Fala and not to the united parishes of Fala and Soutra the agent made his appearance again at the meeting which was held on Tuesday with a supplementary presentation and also a letter acceptance from Mr Monroe. The agent when asked admitted that he had not with him a Presbyterial certificate; and he stated that he would not ask the Presbytery to sustain the presentation with relative papers at that meeting. But he intimated that he intended to appear at the next meeting which is appointed to be held on the 22d of February and he expected to be able to show that the Presbytery should then sustain the presentation and relative documents. Splendid Meteor. –On Tuesday evening about eight o'clock a meteor of unusal size and splendour was witnessed in this quarter. The evening was very clear the sky being without a cloud and the moon shining brightly. Suddenly a dazzling blaze of light burst from the sky illuminating Benlomond and the distant hills the Curse around Craigforth and indeed the earth and air on every side as far as the eye could reach with all the brilliancy of noon-day. The phenomenon appeared like a ball of fire of an oblong shape and apparently almost twice the size of the moon having at the time somewhat of the same silvery appearance as that luminary but flaming with a brilliancy so intense as almost to dazzle the eyes. A tail of fire somewhat resembling that of a rocket but composed of the most beautifully varied colours streamed behind it for a short distance adding much to its spendour and giving the whole an appearance at once singularly magnificent and sublime. Before it disappeared it assumed a red glowing appearance and then burst for an instant enveloping the earth and sky in a blaze as bright and dazzling as the most vivid lightning. It appeared to pass from the south to the north inclining towards the earth. To the eye it seemed to burst and disappeared above Gargunnock. Another meteor of the same kind but much less in size brilliancy and splendour was observed falling in a quartr rather farther to the south a few minutes previously. It is a coincidence worthy of notice that a meteor of the same nature with that first described in the above was seen at the same hour in Glasgow.– Stirly Journal. Glasgow. –The collection made on Sabbath afternoon last by the Rev. Mr Macfarlane's congregation Nicholson Street Glasgow amounted to t46 7s. 6d. This sum is the more praiseworthy when it is considered that this congregation has within a few months subscribed among themselves nearly t1000 for the erection of their beautiful place of worship to be called Erskine Church of which they are erelong to take possession. The Unemployed in Paisley.–The number of unemployed in Paisley has last week decreased by 43. In Kilbarchan and Barrhead they were still on the increase. The following is the official report of yesterday for Paisley and Barrhead :– Paisley. Males 1865 Dependants 4662 –6527 Females 1680 Dependants 3360 –5040 Total 11567 Barrhead. December 17 287 ... 23 346 Increase 59 – Paisley Advertiser. The Paisley Manufacturing Committee. –This Committee continue to carry on their operations with energy and zeal. The amount of the fund now exceeds t8000 and is still on the increase. They have given out about 700 webs already and are as busy as possible preparing more. Unable to get a sufficiency of webs warped in Paisley they have sent for assistance in this respect both to Glasgow and Johnstone. A good deal of work has this week been given to warpers winders and heddle-casters. They have taken much more spacious premises in Gilmour Street in order that they may the more easily supply both town and country weavers. It is desirable that the implement fund should be somewhat enlarged as the other funds of the Committee are not trenched on for that purpose – Ibid. Ducal Generosity.–After the late county meeting at Hamilton at which addresses were voted to the Queen and Prince Albert his Grace the Duke of Hamilton and several of those who had attended the meeting visited the jail. One respectable looking female attracted his Grace's attention; and on inquiry he was told that she was the widow of a respectable wood merchant now deceased and had been confined for upwards of a year at the instance of a law agent in Edinburgh for costs incurred in a suit in the Court of Session. His Grace immediately caused the truth of the poor woman's story to be investigated and on being satisfied of the facts he caused the debt to be paid by his factor and procured the woman's liberation who has thus through his Grace's generosity been restored to liberty and to the superintendence of her young family.– Reformers' Gazette. Presentation. –A number of the members of the United Secession Church Airdrie met in their vestry on the evening of Wednesday the 22d inst. when Councillor Brown in name of the congregation presented the Rev. M. M'Gavin A.M. their pastor with a handsome pulpit gown and cassock as a mark of their respect and esteem; after which a number of the influential members of the congregation entertained him to supper supper in Mr Witherspoon's King's Arms Inn– Mr Daniel Gray collector Coltness Railway in the chair and Dr Clarkson croupier–when the evening was spent in the most friendly happy and intellectual manner. A Rescue.–Last week while the Duke of Hamilton was riding along the wood leading from Hamilton to Bothwell he heard the screams of a female and on looking towards the place whence the cries came he perceived a stout Irishman belabouring a woman in a most unmerciful style. No sooner did he observe this than he rode up to the scene of cruelty dismounted from his horse knocked the savage down rescued the woman and sent her home rejoicing with more money in her pocket than it may have been her lot to possess for a long time. When we recollect that his Grace was born so long ago as October 1767 and so is in his 75th year we cannot sufficiently admire his gallantry humanity and intrepidity– Glasgow Chronicle. Town Council. –The usual meeting of Council did not take place yesterday in consequence of the Christmas holidays. House of Industry. –We understand that Miss Grace Bailie had left a legacy to the Edinburgh House of Industry of ten pounds sterling. Old Church.–The Lords of her Majesty's Treasury have officially intimated to the parties interested their intention to adhere to the original arrangement made with the Town Council for altering the Assembly Aisle and rendering it fit to be permanently used as a place of worship for the accomodation of one of the city congregations. Prince of Wales Fund. –In the table of sums subscribed in the different Wards of Police published in our paper of Saturday last that indicated for the 26th Ward was t120 12s. 9d. Mr Lindores the General Commissioner requests us to state that the sum subscribed in his Ward was t275 12s. 9d. and that the difference between the two sums is the amount of the very handsome subscriptions by the Banks in St Andrew Square and which were drawn by the Treasurer. Presentation of Plate. –On Friday afternoon about fifty citizens entertained Mr William Donaldson of the Albion Cloth Company to an elegant dinner and dessert in the Turf Hotel Princes Street for the purpose of presenting him with a testimonial of their esteem subscribed for by the members of the Celtic Lodge and other private friends. Mr William Wright hat manufacturer was in the chair supported on the right and left by the guest of the evening Mr Pritchard of the Theatre-Royal and other gentlemen. Mr Dick of the Albion officiated as croupier. After the usual loyal and preliminary toasts had been given the chairman called for a bona fide bumper for the toast of the evening and after passing a handomse eulogium on those various qualities of their guest which had endeared him to all his friends neighbours and acquaintances far and wide presented to Mr Donaldson in the name of the subscribers a very elegant and massive silver tea set of the value of t50. Mr Donaldon's health was then proposed and drunk with warm and friendly enthusiasm. The presentee replied to the compliment in modest and appropriate terms. The company spent an exceedingly happy and convivial night; the chairman and croupier taking care that there should be no flagging in the jovialty. The toasts were suitable to the occasion. Mr Mackenzie's instrumental band played appropriate airs to the various toasts and sentiments; and vocal music from amateurs was never wanting; the guest himself being a host in that department. The following inscription is neatly engraved on the various pieces of playe :–To Mr William Donaldson R.W.M. of the Lodge Celtic of Edinburgh and Leith from a number of Masonic and other Friends.–24th Dec. 1841. Theft and Recovery of a Pony. –At a late hour on Sunday night a gentleman residing in the southern part of the town dismounted from his pony at his own gate and proceeding inwards leaving the animal to follow as he was wont to do to the stable. On looking about he observed a young man whom he supposed to be his son take the reins and mount the pony. Shortly afterwards the son came into the house and the question of Where is the pony? soon convinced the parties that it was stolen. They immediately proceeded in search and while the gentleman was giving information at the Police-Office his son discovered the pony with a rider on the North Bridge. He immediately seized the reins and made a clutch at the thief; but the latter very adroitly threw himself off at the opposite side ran down the Fleshmarket stairs and escaped. Providential Recovery. –One day last week a fine little child about five years of age belonging to one of the villagers at Ratho having dandered[?] away with another little play-fellow like himself to a little distance from the house fell into a deep well. His companion was found standing weeping at the edge. The apparently dead body of the little one being got out was taken home and all hopes of its recovery given up when Dr Pringle and excellent young gentleman who is presently assistant of Dr Craig at Ratho made his appearance and by applying himself with indefatiguable perseverance succeeded in recalling the apparently extinguished spark. The next the little romp was as lively as ever. Mungo Park. –A public meeting was held in the town hall of Selkirk on Monday the 26th current the Chief Magistrate in the chair; when various resolutions were adopted with the view of erecting a monument or other permanent mark of respect for the memory of this celebrated traveller. Thimble-Riggers. –A band of thimble-riggers from Edinburgh have for several weeks past been infesting the roads in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. They are six in number and one of them an old man of rather respectable appearance is generally in advance of the party and having got into conversation with a passenger on the road and the others running up and desiring the old man to try his luck; he does so and winning a trifle he easily persuades the person with whom he has been ingratiating himself to try also and he is soon robbed of his whole spare cash. Information having on Wednesday last been given to the Procurator-Fiscal at Pollokshaws and the gang were on the new Kilmarnock Road he immediately despatched two rural police officers in pursuit of them. On the officers coming up to the gang they separated and ran off but the officers captured two of them (the old man and another) who were safely lodged in Pollokshaws Jail; and having been brought before two of the Justices and several person having sworn to being defrauded by them of their money they were sentenced tothirty days' imprisonment in Paisley House of Correction with hard labour as rogues and vagabonds; and an active look-out is made by the police for the remainder of the gang. Stoppage of Payments by the Town of Paisley. –Partly on account of the great depression of trade and partly on account of a run raised by the circulation of malicious and false statements regarding the affairs of the community of Paisley theTown Council at a meeting on Wednesday evening ordered the Chamberlain to susspend receipt or payment of deposits in the meantime but to proceed with all possible despatch in realizing the outstanding debts due to the community for the regular payment of the interest on the money borrowed and other current engagements of the burgh. It is pretty generally known that a small portion of the would-be-political leaders of the town who have not the influence to get themselves placed in municipal authority have for a good number of years endeavoured to embarass the party in power by attacking the credit of the community. The unfavourabout state of trade and the leniency of the Council in not enforcing during the last year the exactions on the owners of property for entries &c. falling due caused a deficiency of nearly t300 in the usual amount of revenue. This simple circumstance was taken advantage of though nothing was lost thereby and statements prejudicial to the town's credit were placed in the hands of every credito that could be found by the individuals referred to and thus uncalled for alarm raised. In addition to this the adherents of the same party in the Council during the last five days gave currency to another statement which they knew to be quite untrue about the late Provost having commenced to secure himself by drawing a thousand pounds when the fact was he had not drawn out a penny. From the position to which which the affiars the town are now driven a full and public exposure of these matters will soon be submitted to the creditors. The Council have been negotiating for such a loan of money as will pay off those who are dissatisfied which in the ordinary state of the money market they would long since have obtained though at present that is difficult. As regards risk to the creditors from the best informed quarters we are assured there is none. More than one-third of the whole debts of the town are due to the Bank and the members of Council or their immediate friends and fully a half of the debt against the river is due to the same parties. This we should conceive the strongest proof that could be adduced of the confidence of those who should best know the state of the town's affairs.– Glasgow Chronicle. Disgraceful Trick.–At a late wake in the country a short way from Crieff a waggish fellow tied a cord secretly to the neck of the corpse and while a number of young men and women present were going on merrily with some sport the wag pulled the cord when corpse started up in the bed making the clothes to fly off; the whole party rushed to the door crying for mercy upon them and knocking each other over in the hurry when at length some people came to their assistance who afterwards discovered the cause of their terror.– Perth Courier. The Church Question. –Long ago Dr Chalmers let out the secret of the clerical movement by declaring that very little of Non-intrustion would satisfy him and his friends provided the independent power of the Church were secured. Now this liberum arbitrium does nothing at all for Non-intrusion; but it does a great deal for Church Independence. It confers no privilege on the laity; but it adds immeasurably to the power of the clergy. It is in fact the very worst part of the claims that have been advanced by the Church; and its effects would simply be to sacrifice the lay Non-intrusionists on the one hand and clerical Moderates on the other. It means literally uncontrolled power to the Church The General Steam Navigation Company's ship Monarch Captain Fraser arrived at Granton from London on Monday evening at half-past nine o'clock. Election of a Minister for Old Monk- land. –The election of a minster took place at Old Monkland Church on Thursday the 23d inst. and the right of patronage being vested in the Heritors and Kirk-Session the election might be considered a popular one. About 150 voters attended the meeting and a decided wish having been expressed by it is understood the whole of the heritors that no candidate known to be connected with the Non-intrusion party in the Church should be chosen the meeting acting upon this principle unanimously agreed to elect the Rev. Mr Johnston Greenock as minister of the parish. Considering the number of voters the unanimity that prevailed among the electors it is believed is without precedent and stongly marks the sentiments and feelings of a large and very populous parish on the present proceedings of the dominant party in th Church. Mr Johnston was proposed by General Pye Douglass of Rosehall seconded by Mr M'Caul of Daldowie and unanimously elected.– Reformers' Gazette. Destructive Fire. –About three o'clock on the morning of the 25th curt. an alarm of fire was given at Balmangan Mill in the parish of Rerwick. The premises are occupied by Mr Kissock and despite the great exertions of himself servants and neighbours the work of destruction proceeded with a degree of rapidity that rendered it impossible to save a single article. The flames in their fury having charred the rafters the roof fell in with a loud crash; and before long the entire mill with the exception of the side walls became an unbroken mass of ruins. The building contained a considerable quantity of grain and oatmeal the property of the tacksman all of which was unforunately destroyed. As the premises were found quite safe a very few hours previously suspicion of incendiarism have naturally arisen but no clue thus far has been found attaching guilt to a single individual. The fire if wilful implies the blackest malice and it is sad to think that any one could have been so wicked as to destroy what thousands are in want of and would gladly toil for if they only knew how–daily bread– Dumfries Courier. Hamilton. –Some influential persons in Hamilton and the neighbourhood have subscribed to build an Episcopal chapel in that town. We have been informed that all the requisite arrangements have been made for carrying the views of the subscribers into effect. This is one effect of the conduct of the rebellious majority of the General Assembly. Many of thsoe now friendly to the scheme never dreamed of espousing Episcopacy till they have been driven in disgust from the Church of their fathers by the conduct of their ministers; men who exist in their offices by law and yet set that very law at defiance in virtue of which they hold offices and draw their temporalities as they cantingly term their good things which alone induce some of them at least to remain members of the venerable Establishment. Who would have believed some years ago that Black Prelacy was about to be established within sight of Bothwell Brigg!  ID329,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,01,31,inform,Extract of a letter from Boston New England Dec. 11. The demands for the produce of America are most rapidly increasing: one single house has actuallyexported and sold within a very short time 2000 barrels of pot and pear ashes 2000 barrels of beef 500 ditto of pork 70000lb. weight of butter and 1500 bushels of bean and peas. Our news from New York is very disagreeable indeed. Gen. Scott Major Fountain Major Willis Capt. M'Murtry and Lieut.

Winchester Oct. 20. By recent intelligence from Kentucky we learn that a short time ago an American vessel was seized at New Orleans and her cargo disposed of by the Spaniards. Also that the troop which went out against the Indians had not far from the banks of the Ohio fallen in with about forty of them whom they made their prisoners after a slight resistance; and that having washed them 15 turned out to be white men. Philadelphia Nov 9. We hear from undoubted authority that a considerable loan has been negotiated in Holland for the service of these United States. Albany Nov. 4. The Legislature of Vermont have resolved to pay to the State of New York 30000 dollars agreeably to the first proposition contained in the declaration of the Commissioners of this State appointed to declare the consent of the Legislature thereof that a certain territory within the jurisdiction of the State of New York be erected into a new State on the 17th of October last; in consequnece whereof all rights and titles to lands within the State of Vermont under grants of the late colony of New York or from the State of New York (except such grants as were intended as confirmations of those from New Hampshire) cease and determine. The Legislature have also resolved that a Convention be called for taking into consideration the constitution of the United States; the members to be elected in December and the Convention to Meet the first week in Jauary. The Legislature have adjourned to meet again on the first Thursday in January for the purpose (we suppose) of choosing Senators and affixing the time and manner of electing Representatives for Congress. New York Nov. 18. The following resolution has passed the House of Representatives of the State of Virginia now in session: Resolved That so much of this act entitled An Act making provision for the provision for the debt of the United States in their redemption of the public debt is dangerous to the rights and subversive of the interest of the people; and demands the marked disapprobation of the General Assembly. Portland Nov. 15. The stone work of the light house at the entrance of our harbour is now completed. On Tuesday the 9th instant the last stone was laid by Mr. Nichols of this town master builder. The work is extremely well executed. The lighthouse is now 70 feet high. To this the lanthorn which is to be six feet in diameter will add about 15 feet 85 feet in whole. The lanthorn is now preparing and will probably be raised and lighted by the first of next month. Baltimore Nov. 23. A society of respectable gentlemen of this place have raised an adequate fund for the establishment of an extensive manufacture of gunpowder and the necessary mill-works will be speedily erected in the vicinity of this town. This important insituation will not only prove highly advantageous to this State and town but may if properly encouraged become a national benefit. York (Pennsylvania) Nov 10. From Wright's Ferry we learn that about four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon as a boat was coming from the East side a most tremendous storm arose when she was about half way over by which means she was soon filled with water and sunk. there was six passengers and the??? in her (besides a small light waggon and three horses viz. a clergyman the owner of the waggon with his wife and three children; when the storm came on the woman and children took shelter in the waggon but it continued to blow with such violence that the waggon was torn out of the boat and the body having by chance got loose from the carriage and being pretty tight floated some distance till its progress was stopped by a rock; the husband viewing the melancholy situations of his wife and children resolved to relieve or perish with them and quitting the boat swam to the waggon cut open the cover with his knife and with difficulty kept their heads above water till they were relieved by a boat from the West side; by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappeared; the Clergyman just as he found the boat sinking mounted his horse one of the boatmen mounted on one of the waggon horses and by this means preserved themselves till they were relieved by a boat; the other boatman of the name of Tim Sulivan depending on his skill in swimming got up an oar but it is thought he is drowned as he has not since been heard of; the boat was found in the falls and one of the waggon horses that had been given up for lost was found next day some distance below the falls with all his geers on and does not appear to have received the least injury. Extract of a letter from Sunbury Northumberland County (Pennsylvania) dated Nov. 13. One of the men who murdered the Indians at Pine Creek was tried on Saturday evening and though a number of witnesses clearly proved the hand he had in perpetrating the horrid deed and the confession of his counsel at the bar that confirmed it yet notwithstanding an express charge from the judges to bring him in guilty the jury in a few moments returned with a verdict in his favour and a subscription to pay the costs of the suit that he might be immediately set at liberty; and all this from a most absurd idea which the Attorney General with all his endeavours could not beat out of them that the crime was not the same to kill an Indian as a white man: for some minuets the Chief Justice was mute with astonishment. How the State can pacify the Indians now Heaven knows while at this moment the other murderers are at large in this country and no one will arrest them.  ID97,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,09,12,entertain,The laws of the State of Pennsylvania and that of Massachusetts by which the punishment of death is abolished in all cases except for wilful murder are about to be adopted by the respective Legislatures of all the other States. The system of the great and merciful???caria has taken place of the sanguinary Penal laws of England. The abolition of Negro slavery which has taken shape in the five New England States of New Hampshire Massachusets Rhode island Connecticut and Vermont; in the Midland States of New York New Jersey Pennsylvania and Delawar; and in the Western State of Kentucky for several years past is now extended by act of Congress to the Southern States of Virginia North Carolina South Carolina Georgia and Maryland; and the emancipation of the remainder of that unfortunate race of men is to take place on or before the fifth of November 1795. The Legislature of the State of Massachusetts has g???ed a part of the public lands to the emancipated Negroes of that State in proportion to the numbers of the respective families where the liberal and philanthropic mind is gratified by seeing them erect villages cultivate farms and form communities of civilized Societies. Before the Gentleman who has favoured us with this Intelligence left America they had established a Lodge of Masonry; and he had the satisfaction of seeing them on a grand day parade to Church in all the magnificence of the Order where a sermon was preached on the occasion by one of their own colour. They have also endowed public schools employed??? and erected places of Public Worship. The Officers Non-commissioned Officers and Soldiers who served in the Continental army and established the Liberty of their Country have at last received a reward infinitely beyond their expectations but every way corresponding with the liberty of a great and rising Republic. Five hundred acres of land have been voted by Congress this last Session to each individual who served throughout the war; and to the defendants of those who fell in contending for the Rights of Nature and eequal proportion to those who served for a shorter period; and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real value to the injury of the Patriotic Veteran as has been the case of former grants he is allowed his option of taking its value in sterling money at the present market price from the Treasure of the States; or any part in land and the rest in moneya s may be most agreeable to the receiver. The Mint of the United States which was established two years since has begun to issue its hold and silver coin: the copper has been delivered some time. The gold coins are eagles half eagles and quarter eagles. The first is exactly five and forty shillings English money or ten American coin. The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half and quater which makes the courie of exchange simple and suits the reckoning to a very capacity–as our Readers will perceive that ten quarter dollars make the quarter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle; and ten dollars the eagle. There is besides one more silver coin which is called a Dime and is the tenth part of a dollar. The copper coin is called a Cent and is the tenth part of a Dime. Six of the ships of war which were voted by Congress in November last are completed and put in commission: the remaining twenty four will be ready by Midsummer next and will complete a fleet of??? hundred guns. The city of Washington which in five years more will be the Capital of the United States will in every respect be the first in the world: the Capitol or Congress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence and c??? a full and complete view of every part of the city as well as a considerable extent of the country around. The President's house likewise stands upon a rising ground near the banks of the Potamac possessing a delightful water prospect together with a commanding view of the Capitol and some other material parts of the city. From the President's house to the Capitol run two great pleasure parks or malls which intersect and terminate upon the banks of the Potomac and are ornamented at the sides by elegant buildings for Foreign Ministers. The four fronts of the Capitol as well as those of the President's house are of the finest marble. The building of these superb edifices has been much retarded by the want of stone cutters masons bricklayers carpenters and blacksmiths who at this time actually receive the enormous wages of ten shillings American currency per day. The district of Country at the back of North Carolina reaching to the Mississippi and covering a country six hundred miles long by three hundred broad is next winter to be formed into a Sixteenth State; and the Province of Maine extending from the borders of New Hampshire to the river St. Croix is expected to form a Seventeenth. The new cities build in America since her independence are Grenville in the State of Georgia; Martenberg the Capitol of North Carolina; Columbia the Capital of South Carolina; Noxville and Nashville in the Tenesee Settlements; Danville Fairfield and Lex ington in the State of Kentucky; Washington the Capital of the United States; Sunbury in the State of Pennsylvania; Hudson upon Husdon's River and Cooper's Town in the State of New York; Bennington in the State of Vermont; and Paterson in the State of New Jersey.

Its fur though beautiful and magnificent is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of the Southern Provinces. Pekin is therefore the proper mart for this valuable commodity and in this immense city the consumption is so great that the produce of the voyage meets and immediate sale. The Mandarins of the Court and even the Emperor himself are fond of wearing this costly fur. To a citizen of common rank a sea otter's collar to his vestment is a luxury. The natives of the North West Coast of Ameerica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds that all the blankets cloths hats and stockings that could be procured in China if English manufacture were sold to the Indians with whose Chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed. An act of cruelty committed by an officer of the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to be recorded. The Spaniards discovering that Callicum a Chief second in authority at Nootka Sound was in alliance with the English he was shot through the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife of Callicum with an infant child escaped but not till wounded. Macquilla the Chief first in command retired at the head of the allies of England from Nootka Sound and to avoid the cruelty of the Spaniards they fled to distant parts. Such of the natives as they could seize the Spaniards condemned to work as slaves on their fortifications. At this period it was in the contemplation of the Spaniards to seize the Sandwich Islands with a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. And we further add on authority that amounts nearly to demonstration that on the very lands purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain Mears the Spaniards have already opened valuable mines. Another object of this enterprise wasto supply the markets of Kamschatka and other ports belonging to the Russians with the teas and other produce of China. This promised to be an invaluable channel of commerce as the Chinese have shut their ports against the Russians who On this voyage of discovery and experiment one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo but was unfortunately lost on her return to China. To these curious particulars we add with a patriot joy that the consumption of the glorious staple of England her broad cloths is astonishingly great in Japan and China: British hard ware &c. is also in great request. From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may depend on the utmost attention and civility.

Intelligence has been received that in some trivial dispute with a native Indian a Spaniard has stabbed him to the heart with a stiletto and then fled. The nation to whom the Indian belonged being made acquainted with the murder sent a deputation to the Governor demanding that five Spaniards should be instantly delivered up as an attonement. This was peremptorily refused as being more than commensurate to the offence but the murderer was offered as a satisfaction; the Indians would not accept him singly and departed vowing the severest revenge: a few days afterwards intelligence was received that they had surprised and massacred sixteen men who had been at work in the woods; and when the vessel departed the Spaniards were flying with the utmost precipitation and terror from all parts of the country seeking shelter in the forts.  ID354,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,10,08,entertain,Extract of a letter from Luxene County. On Saturday the 1st of July I left Tioga point near the middle of the day; about half after one o'clock P. M. a shower appeared to be rising from the north west and I had scarcely time to take shelter in the house of Obadiah Gore Esq; at Sheshequen before the storm came on attended with heavy thunder and lightening and a violent gale of wind with rain. The storm continued up wards of half an hour during which time to see the tumbling of timber during the storm was surprising. After it abated I continued on my journey but found it very difficult travelling in many places the road being blocked up by the falling of timber. I reached Wilksbarree on Wednesday. It appears that the storm extended through the country and at the same hour of the day blew more violent in some places than others. At Exeeter about nine miles from Wilksbarrie a level plain loaded with pitch pine timber was swept of its timber; scarce a tree left for more than a mile in length and three fourths of a mile wide being either torn up by the roots or twisted off leaving their stumps from 5 to 30 feet high. A number of buildings in different parts of the country stript of their roofs and otherways damaged–fences in many place removed and many fields of corn others grain and flax laid level with the earth–cattle killed by the falling of timber in every part of the country. A Mr. –Lot who lived at Mahooper about 35 miles from Wilksbarre whose family consisted of his wife and a number of children– he with his wife being absent children seeing themselves in danger in the house left it at the instant a large tree was falling; the tree reached them a small distance from the door and a girl about eleven years of age was crushed to pieces about expired instantly. One of the other children had a thigh and both arms broke another badly wounded in the head–these two it is feared has received the fatal blow two other slightly wounded. Extract of a letter from Richmond Virginia dated July 28. By accounts from Kentucky we are informed that about the 1st of this month a party of Indians appeared near Frankfort and took a great number of horses and negroes. Col. M'Dowell with 300 men pursued them to the Ohio; but not falling in with them he crossed the river leaving 100 men to take care of his horses; after marching about 12 or 15 miles overtook a large party when a severe engagement ensued but being overpowered by numbers was obliged to retreat. He then sent for the men left behind and came up with the Indians the next day and after engaging some time obliged them to make a precipitate retreat. Col. M'Dowell took six Indian warriors two Englishmen and a Frenchman from Detroit and all the negroes and horses. Newtown June 27. On the 13th instant the meeting house in Newtown was removed about eight rods the removal was effected in one hour and an half after previous preparations for the purpose had been made.

They had been met at Niagara by Indian commissioners and with them had sailed in separate vessels to the mouth of Detroit river 18 miles from Detroit where our commissioners were directed to remain until an asswer should be brought from the great council of Indian nations assembled at the rapids of the Miami and the Lake. On the 2d of August an answer was brought to this effect that the only terms onw hich peace could be made was our ceding the country on the west of the Ohio and Allegheny rivers. The commissioners suggested the impossibilities of doing this as the lands had been sold by the Congress and people had settled on them but that the United States would be willing to give more goods than they had given at any other time. The Indians replied that if the Congress would give one half these goods to the people that had settled the would leave the land and remove the difficulty. Our commissioners replied that the land they must have and would not give it up. The Indians said it was well and there need no more be said. However desired them to remain if they thought proper until they returned to the council and laid this before them. On the 16th of August two Indians came and informed that the final result of their deliberations was the country in question or war. The express is of opinion from the language of individual Indians in private and from other circumstances that the British wholly conduct their council and dictate their demands. By the arrival of some person from Fort Washington on Monday last we are informed that the Indians still contiue hovering about our garrisons and occasionally stealing horses that the army is in high spirits anxiously waiting the event of the treaty and hoping that a campaign will take place as no idea of peace is entertained by any one; that the greatest pains has been taken by the commander in chief in training his men in the act wood fighting and that from their proficiency and the???imity prevailing throughout the whole army success may be expected should a campaign take place. New York Sept. 17. A Mr. Spier was removed from his lodgings in this city on Sunday last to Governors Island where he died this morning.

One of the drivers had a very narrow escape with his life being cruelly fired upon at Trenton; the ball passing within a few inches of his head! The ladies &. have been without any refreshment on the road as the panic and terror with which every mind is possessed by the writings and measures above alluded to prevented their obtaining any accommodations on the road– O tell it not in Gath! declare it not in the streets of Askelon ! Ye New Yorkers and ye Baltimorians you have been generous to strangers; but forgot the charitable and fraternal attention due to your own fellow-citizens! Sept. 25. Extract of a letter from a gentleman who lately left his city on his way to the southward. We were stopped about seven miles from Baltimore by armed men who used us with every indignity and hatred truly indicative of malice prepense. These detained us in the stage from five to the afternoon until ten the ensuing morning; during this interval one of these ruffians who appeared to be a German snapped his piece at one of this party who seemed inclined to leave the stage with an apparent design to go among the bushes nears the road; this guard in their tender mercy wre pleased to hand us a piece of dry cheese on the end of a pitch-fork. After this quarantine we were permitted to go to Gray's Garden and there to perform another for the space of two days and nights. New-York Sept. 28. Extract of a letter from Philadelphia to a gentleman in Baltimore dated the 20th instant. You request I would endeavour to give you a parti cular account of the state of the city in general and the rise and progress of the malignant fever now raging here. I believe it will be difficult precisely to determine its origin; but it is generally admitted to have been imported from Cape-Francois in a vessel which came to a wharf betwen Arch and Race-street beause the infection broke out ina house connected with that vessel and it was afterwards traced to that vessel. The disorder overtook several families thereabouts. But most people apprehended it to be the general fall-fever which acted severly on those who had the influenza–To that there was no material danger apprehended until the death of Peter Ashton in Vine-street who after a short illness died about one month past; after which the disorder was clearly discovered to be the putrid or yellow fever and each person became after of his neighbours insomuch that if any became sick they were avoided and many fled from the sick leaving them in adestitute situation perhaps shut up in a house and the neighbours alarmed merchants and housekeepers moved into the country and fear was stamped on every countenance–infirmness possessed the hearts of the people–little business was done except packing up–engaging waggons to move goods into the country and searching for shelter for their families; many families set off without having a particular place to go to. Thus the country became alarmed. Individuals died in the country–but I cannot learn ?hat it spread there. The overseers duty became exceedingly heavy and several of them were taken sick; others abandoned their post and the business bore very hard on the remaining few. Finding deaths increasingly abundantly they procured carpenters to make coarse coffins by the do???. The malady still increasing in Water Front Race and Vine-street threatened desolation in those quarters. The overseers moved by the distresses of the helpless took possession of Bush-Hill mansion (it being empty) and erected a hospital employed some physicians and nurses; sent out some accomadations and provided for interring the dead. The overseers became inadequate to the business by reason fo fear; few in number and the funds exhausted; added to this the extravagant wages of the nurses two and three dollars per day most of the magistrates fled; the house of employment and hospital shut their doors against all indigent and indisposed persons. Thus were the people who had been private patientes on the poor list abandoned and had no sheltering place and those who were slightly indisposed were sent to Bush-Hill and became victims with many others. The inhabitants were requested to meet by public advertisement and a committee of 40 was appointed to take charge of the Bush-Hill hospital and to relieve the distressed in the city and its vicinity they became organized Ianto693 negociated a loan in the bank two of the number voluntarily offered their service to see the business of Bush-Hill properly conducted; bedsteads were procured the house cleaned matrons appointed and nurses under their direction; an apothecary with medicine &c. and four physicians to attend once a day. The remainder of the committee attend at the State House receive information from the committee at Bush - Hill and supply their demands; receive all sheets shirts &c. &c. at the State-House also keep a supply of ready made coffins to furnish as occasion required. Several carts are procured for the various purposes of carrying out the sick whom the doctors pronounce to have the fever of disposing the corpsand for carrying provisions and other necessaries to and from the hospital. THere is also a house fitted up and under the care of a matron to be for the use of those children whose parents have died with the fever; as all their relations and neighbours are shy of them; the governor has directed the State Treasury to be open for their use and they to be accountable to him for their expenditures.–The city seems quite solitary and business at a stand; deaths numerous and no parade at the interment of any; the bells do not ring nor is there any invitations to the funeral of any. I think about 1000 have died since the disorder first made its appearance but it cannot be ascertained with precision; and we think between 15 and 20000 removed from their habitations. The doctors suppose the disorder a little checked by the cool weather; how that is I know now. By a passenger arrived from Albany this morning we learn that in order to prevent the introduction of the Yellow Fever in Albany they have formed Committees and fixed a Gun-Boat at some distance from the city where all vessels are stopt till the Doctors examine the passengers– And that Colonel Hamilton and Lady were arrived but were denied admittance into the city and had taken lodgings at a Mr. M'Gown's at Green-Bush. October 2. Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Philadelphia to the Printers of this PAper dated September 28. The papers must have amply informed you of the melancholy situation of this city for five or six weeks past. Grave digging has been the only business carrying on; and ndeed I may say of late Pit digging where people are interred indiscriminately in three tiers of coffins. From the most accurate observations I can make upon matters I think I speak within bounds when I Say eighteen hundred persons have perished (I do not say all of the yellow fever) since its first appearance on the 3d of August in North Water-street; others think a larger number–but I confess we are a good deal in the dark on the subject at present and it will take some time to have accurate returns made. People have been hitherto so panic struck that little has been attnded to but the means of self-preservation; gloom and melancholy is on every persons countenance; nothing but the yellow fever is talked of; the street are often seen without a passenger; the wharfs are deserted the markets miserable and uncommonly high and nearly one half the citizens departed. The city is truly republican; pomp and distinction have in a great measure disadpeared and bad Plato himself come among us to preach up the practice of true republicansim his lectures could not have had a greater effect upon the minds of men than the present mortality. We make use of no other precaution for avoiding the contagion than not going into infected houses–keeping our own well aired clean and frequently having the walls white-washed. considering the general terro I have more than once felt my pulse to discover whether I was really alive or not; however I now begin to hoep we may escape as cool weather is fast approaching and one-street in general healthy. Of all things this yellow fever is the most insidious– its approaches are generally gradual–a person imagines himself well when he is dying–other loss the use of reason entirely and die in that situations. with those few that recover its effects are long left. It acts like a steeltrap–when once it gets hold of a person it does not easily let him get off. Philadelphia Oct. 7. Died of Sunday the 29th ult. Samuel Powell Esq. Speaker of the Senate of this commonwealth a gentleman of a benevolent disposition an improved mind a sound understanding and an honest heart. Died on Friday evening after a short illness with the present maligant fever at Mrs. Grant's–Mr Chase a yong gentleman of respectable connections of Baltimore. Winchester Sept. 20. Extract of a letter from our correspondent at??? Creek Territory South of the Ohio dated Sept. 4. Times here were but a gloomy aspect. The???le daily harassed by the Indians. On the 27th of August a party consisting of about 300 killed Lieut. Janks Tedford of the United States troops and a Mr. JAckson as they were gathering corn in a field for their horses near Henry's stations–They have lately burnt many houses on the Nine Mile and destroyed a prodigious quantity of wheat rye and corn. WE hope Governor Blount on his return to this territory will be invested with power to desstroy these barbarous tribes. From the same dated Sept. 14. On the 30th of August some Indians killed one young woman and scalped another in Washington county; and on the 5th instant a part of them wounded four persons and scalped one about nine miles from Green Court - House; a house was also attacked by them but they were forced to retreat by the owner thereof and one of his daughters who fired several rounds and wounded some of them. On the 16th another party of the savages killed a woman and child on Nine-Mile. New-York Oct. 16. Monday evening last a number of persons assembled in the fields when they commenced the demolition of Mother Cay's house which in a short time was intirely resed to the ground floor; the furniture beds clothing &c. were all destroyed. another house of ill fame tenanted by Mother Giles under went a similar fate. It is aid that three persons were wounded one dangerously from the firing of small arms by some persons who were placed in the house for its defence.–We lament that our worthy Mayor received some injury in endeavouring to disperse the people.  ID374,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,07,18,inform,Winchester May 19. Two men named Timmons brothers as also one Nimrod Higgins were killed in the wilderness between Yellow Creek and Cumberland Mountain about the 20th ult. by Indians. Three persons were also lately killed by Indians in Harrison county near the mouth of the Little Kennaway. By a letter from the territory south of the Ohio dated April 25 we learn that on the 22d of that month a large party of Indians killed sever person within seven miles of Knoxville and stole 60 horses from Knox County; that parties of them are daily committing ravages in the territory and that there is no prospect of putting a stop to their enormities while the Whites are restricted from pursuing them across the Tenessee.  ID379,Trewman's Exeter Flying Post,Exeter,England,United Kingdom,1810,01,11,inform,CORONER'S INQUEST.–An inquest was held yesterday evening before Anthony Gell Esq. at the Nag's Head in Grange-court Leicester-square on the body of Ann Paris an unfortunate young creature of interesting appearance not more than 17 years of age who it appeared had been reduced by some unknown melancholy circumstance to the most forlorn and destitute situations. It was stated in evidence that she had taken her lodgings only seven weeks and that during that time she had evinced the most wretched state of mind and on Thursday morning urged on by the poignancy of her feelings or derangement of her intellect she swallowed a considerable quantity of laudanum. On the violence of her death-pangs coming on medical air was sent for but too late to be of any assistance and in a short time she expired.–The Coroner's Jury returned a verdict of Lunacy. The history of this poor young creature is at once romantic and interesting. She is the daughter of a Monsieur Paris who was well known in the commencement of the Revolution and in which he suffered. Madame Paris with her infant daughter took refuge in this country; and in the ruin of her fortune became a governess in a noble family in Scotland. After this she had a house in the New-road; and about two years ago died of the rupture of a blood vessel. Her daughter had been placed at an eminent boarding-school near one of the new squares; and on the death of her mother was placed under the guardianship of a Member of Parliament who with the most liberal and benevolent attention to her destitute situation resolved to complete her education; and she had every master of eminence in all the elegant arts. She spoke French and Italian; touched the piano with great execution; sung with taste; and had read beyond her years. About six or eight months ago she was met in the square when walking with the other young ladies by a young man in the dress of a midshipman who followed her to the door and who wrote to her under the name of Jones. A correspondence took place. Her imagination was fired; and she eloped with him under a promise of marriage. His address was found in her box and they were traced by her guardian and separated. Jones declared that she was virtuous and his intentions were honourable and as a proof of it he was ready to marry her with her guardian's consent. In effect they were married and she was completely undone. In about a fortnight or three weeks Jones threw off his disguise and fairly told her his real character– that he was no sailor but lived by his shifts; that he had married her only for the sum her protector had paid him and that she must provide for herself. She was abandoned; and the shock had such an effect on her imagination that she has ever since shewed signs of a disordered intellect. With a heart that shrunk from vice she was flung on the world without a friend or a home; and in this deplorable state she became the victim of necessity. About three weeks ago she saw an officer who is distinguished for his gallantries and who by his address and attentions so won upon her affections that she could neither speak nor think of any other object. This fatal attachment absorbed her whole soul. They entered into engagements to live and die only for one another; and in the frenzy of this passion or under the idea that she could not be his and his alone she took the desperate resolution of dying for him. She had prepared three phials of opium who of which she swallowed and she died with a spirit of heroism; for no persuasion nor force could make her when seized with the nausea of the poison take any antidote to the draughts. She would not suffer the medical men to approach her–and though after stupefaction came on they administered every known medicine they all failed of effect.  ID380,Examiner,London,England,United Kingdom,1810,01,17,inform,On Friday an Inquest was held at the Nag's Head Leicester-fields on the body of Madamoiselle Ann Paris then lying dead at No. 4 St. Martin's-street Leicester-fields.– Sarah Upton deposed that she is housemaid to the place. She had frequently observed that the unfortunate young lady appeared to be rather flighty and tiresome in her manner such as ringing the bell violently giving orders and almost immediately after giving counter-orders; at other times she would ring with equal violence and when any of the servants inquired what she wanted she would tell them she wanted nothing. At one time the deceased gave the witness a shilling to buy her some laudanum. The witness said Good God Miss you surely must be mad to think of such a thing; besides you know it is contrary to law and I can't procure it. She then set down and wept bitterly; she said she could get it in a minute; she had been used to take it for a pain in her bowels.–The witness replied Very well miss you may kill yourself but I shall not give my assistance to the deed. On Wednesday she went out at two and returned at half after six o'clock. She then said that she had given a coachman a 1 l. note at Brompton she had to pay the man only 2s. but she would not wait for her change as she thought it was much better to lose money than time. She went out about a quarter of an hour after the time of her coming home and returned again at eight o'clock having her bonnet all bedizened with artificial flowers. She got a candle went up to her own apartments and returned in about seven minutes time; she refused to take tea with two ladies that were in the parlour at the time; she sat down at first in an extremely pensive manner then in the course of a minute or two with the utmost wildness in her countenance she exclaimed Oh I shall never see him again! I have done the job–I have taken good care that the laudanum I took should do the business. The witness was instantly alarmed knowing that the deceased had ordered her to get some laudanum for her before then. She ran up stairs in the utmost consternation and saw the phials in the lady's chamber. Upon her return she endeavoured to get some explanation for the poor young lady as to what induced her to commit such an act of desperation but in vain–she looked wild and continued raving for some time and then fell into a state of stupefaction. Medical assistance was sent for; three Professional Gentlemen attended but they could afford her no relief. She died before day light on Thursday morning. The witness knew nothing of any particular visitor to the deceased; neither had she the least knowledge of any of her relations or friends.

Coroner for Westminster on the body of Madamoiselle Ann Paris then lying dead at No. 4 St. Martin's-street Leicester-fields. Sarah Upton deposed that she is housemaid to the place; that the deceased had lodged about seven weeks in the house during which time the witness attended more particularly than any other servant about the person of the deceased. She had frequently observed that the unfortunate young lady appeared to be rather flighty and tiresome in her manner such as ringing the bell violently giving orders and almost immediately after giving counter-orders; at other times she would ring with equal violence and when any of the servants inquired what she wanted she would tell them she wanted nothing. She was also extremely incoherent in her discourse rambling from one subject to another with the utmost rapidity and without there being the least connection between each. In answer to a question from one of the Jurymen the witness said that the deceased was by no means in the habit of drinking but that on the day on which the unfortunate affair took place she thought the deceased appeared wild as if she had been drinking. At one time the deceased told the witness that some one had said she was mad; another time she gave the witness a shilling to buy her some laudanum. The witness said Good God Miss you surely must be mad to think of such a thing; besides you know it is contrary to law and I can't procure it. She then set down and wept bitterly; she said she could get it in a minute; she had been used to take it for a pain in her bowels.– The witness replied Very well Miss you may kill yourself but I shall not give my assistance to the deed. At other times the poor young lady would be to all appearances in excellent spirits when all of a sudden she would burst into tears without any thing being said or done at the time to occasion it. She would sometimes fiddle with her clothes like a person who was beside herself; she would collect a few flowers and deck her hair with them and a thousand other little tricks that appeared to to the witness to be the most manifest proofs of a deranged intellect. On Wednesday she went out at two and returned at half after six o'clock. She then said that she had given a coachman a 1l. note at Brompton she had to pay the man only 2s. but she would not wait for her change as she thought it was much better to lose money than time. She went out about a quarter of an hour after the time of her coming home and returned again at eight o'clock having her bonnet all bedizened with artificial flowers. She got a candle went up to her own apartments and returned in about seven minutes time; she refused to take tea with two ladies that were in the parlour at the time; she sat down at first in an extremely pensive manner then in the course of a minute or two with the utmost wildness in her countenance she exclaimed Oh I shall never see him again! I have done the job–I have taken good care that the laudanum I took should do the business. The witness was instantly alarmed knowing that the deceased had ordered her to get some laudanum for her before then. She ran up stairs in the utmost consternation and saw the phials in the lady's chamber. Upon her return she endeavoured to get some explanation for the poor young lady as to what induced her to commit such an act of desperation but in vain–she looked wild and continued raving for some time and then fell into a state of stupefaction. Immediately on the unfortunate occurrence being known medical assistance was sent for; three Professional Gentlemen attended but they could afford her no relief. She died before daylight on Thursday morning. The witness knew nothing of any particular visitor to the deceased; neither had she the least knowledge of any of her relations or friends. Mr. Emanuel Gristock of Wardour-street surgeon stated that between ten and eleven on Wednesday night he saw the deceased; she refused all medicine that was offered her for the purpose of expelling the poison; with some difficulty however the witness forced part of an emetic down her throat; she said she new she had done wrong; and in disjointed sentences and in broken accents raved something about her loving a young man. Upon examining her apartment the witness found one small bottle full of laudanum and two others empty which evidently had contained the same sort of poisonous liquid; their contents must have been between two and three ounces. He left the patient at twelve being under the necessity of attending another at Knights - bridge. Mr. James Wilkes of the Haymarket surgeon saw the deceased at half after two on Thursday morning; she was then in a state of actual torpor the nervous system appeared to be totally deranged and she was incapable of making the least exertion with her body or limbs. She appeared to be past all hopes of recovery from the moment the witness saw her. However having been previously apprised of the situations of the patient the witness had taken a bottle containing an emetic in his pocket. With the utmost difficulty he forced part of it down her throat but it had no effect–the patient continued in the same torpid state until five o'clock in the morning when she expired. Dr. Hooper prescribed some other medicines which we attempted to be administered ut in vain; the patient was totally incapable of swallowing them. A jeweller had known the young lady for a considerable length of time; he had served her with a variety of trinkets in his line of business and was in the constant habit of attending her two or three times a week. He had frequently observed the poor unfortunate young lady act with the utmost inconsistency and wildness; he had repeatedly known her to burst into tears in the midst of apparent merriment; he had known her to order clothes to dress for going out then turn short and saw she would not go out that day; and he had known her once after sitting for some time in the most pensive mode imaginable start up suddenly and exclaim No I will not stand this. She was between 17 and 18 years of age; he understood that she was born in France but she spoke English as well as French. The day before the occurance of the melancholy transaction which was the subject of the prevsent consideration of the Jury she had with frenzy depicted in her countenance exclaimed Well if my wishes are not fulfilled I shall hang or drown myself. The witness had not the least knowledge of what she alluded to neither had he ever heard that she had any relations in London. He was most decidedly of opinion that she was deranged in her intellects. The Jury without a moment's hesitation returned their verdict– Insanity. The history of this poor young creature is at once romantic and interesting. She is the daughter of a Monsieur Paris who was well known in the commencement of the Revolution and in which he suffered.– Madame Paris with her infant daughter took refuge in this country and in the ruin of her fortune became a governess in a noble family in Scotland.
