Washington at the opening of the Congress of the United States at New York Nov. 6 1792 gives an impartial account of the situation of tha country we are persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives IT is some abatement of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally I am not able to add to it information that the Indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our western frontier have terminated: You will I am persuaded learn with no less concern than I communicate it that reiterated endeavours towards effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop the further effusion of blood–to arrest the progress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable purposes:–In making which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the event or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable; to ascertain unequivocally that such is the case. A detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be laid before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thus far will I trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed. The issue of some of them indeed is still depending; but a favorable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by anything that has yet happened. In the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace; it will I presume be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased. It must add to your concern to be informed that besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it. A part of the Cherokees known by the name of Chickamagas inhabiting five villages on the Tennessee River have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements. It was hoped that the treaty of Holston made with the Cherokee Nation in July 1791 would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities upon the citizens of the United States in that quarter. The information which has been received on this subject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive precautions only have been enjoined and observed. It is not understood that any breach of treaty or aggression whatsoever on the part of the United States or their citizens is even alleged as a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter. I have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited though the number is still incomplete and pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termination of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable. In looking forward to the future expense of the operations which may be found inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year. This however will be better ascertained in the course of the session; and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of the spirit of hostilities. I can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory–To enable by competent rewards the employment of qualified and trusty persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable. The prosperous state of our revenue has been intimated–This would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the United States. These impediments have lessened and are lessened in local extent; and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the law appears to be progressive. But symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in certain quarters I judged a special interposition on my part proper and advisable and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for their object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto. Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders. And Congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend upon me shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws. In fulfilling this trust I shall count entirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of the Government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens. I can not forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the judges of the supreme court which will be laid before you points out some of the inconveniences that are experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws considerations rise out of the structure of the system which in some cases tend to relax their efficacy. As connected with this subject provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the courts of the United States and a supplementary definition of offenses against the constitution and laws of the union and of the punishment for such offenses will it is presumed be found worthy of particular attention. Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary. It would be wise however by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to foreign nations which we may sometimes have occasion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your consideration of the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations and other infractions of the law of nations which furnishes just subject of complaint might endanger our peace with them. And in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpose which takes place if not renewed at the close of the present session. In execution of the authority given by the legislature measures have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our mint; others have been employed at home. Provision has been made of the requisite buildings and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dimes the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them. The regulation of foreign coins in correspondency with the principles of our national coinage as being essential to their due operation and to order in our money concerns will I doubt not be resumed and completed. It is represented that some provisions in the law which establishes the Post-Office operate in experiment against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country.–Should this upon due enquiry be found to be the fact a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and infor mation will I doubt not lead to the application of a remedy. The adoption of a constitution for the state of Kentucky has been notified to me. The legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order. It is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for three millions of florins–one at Antwerp at the annual interest of four and one-half per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of all charges.–The rates of these loans and the circumstances under which they have been made are confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad. Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers according to the provision made during the last session has been embraced. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives. I entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effec tual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt according to the right which has been reserved to the government –no measure can be more desirable whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation. Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made of the Bank of the United States pursuant to the section of the act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made. Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand and I doubt not will engage your early attention. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. I content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects not particularized in my present as have been suggested in my former communications to you. Various temporary laws will expire during the present session. Among these that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes will merit particular notice. The results of your common deliberations hitherto will I trust be productive of solid and durable advantages to our constituents; such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage will tend to strengthen and confirm their attachment upon which under Divine Providence materially depend their union their safety and their happiness. Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivation of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public councils.  ID327,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,02,07,inform,CONGRESS. Wednesday Dec. 8. The SPEECH of George Washington Esq; President of the Congress on??? the ??? Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives I N meeting you again I feel much satisfac tion on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of flourishing commerce. The progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American stock abroad as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculation by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add as it bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the marine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary. In conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of 3000000 of florins towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in Holland.–As well theexchange with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success. The secretary of the treasure has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information. Since your last sessions I have received communication by which it appears that the district of Kentucke at present a part of Virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct number of the Union; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honour to both the par ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will declare on the case submitted to you. It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the north west side of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect–The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity. These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and rewards their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers; and I have accordingly authorised an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended. The disturbed situation of Europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge in means and there by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to ur own navigation as will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms which may fail us in the moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil. Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it destresful to us that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection. The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom whether improvement of a judicatory system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. Yu will consider in your wisdom whether im provements in that system may yet be made and particularly whether??? ???process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal Courts be not desirable through all the States. The patronage of our commerce of our merchants and seamen has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them either by express convention or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases the aid of the National authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect. The establishment of the Militia of a Mint of Standards of Weights and Measures of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course and which are abundantly urged by their own importance. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favourite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt founded but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the measure be toe very public interest as well as be more satisfactory to our constituents. Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives. In perusing the various and weighty business of the present session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the co-operation which an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both and our best reward if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence. (Signed) GEORGE WASHINGTON. United States Dec. 8 1790.  ID341,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,02,22,inform,From the Jamaica Royal Gazette. Kingston Nov. 28. By late arrivals from Hispaniola we learn that the people are in quietness but still armed; and that the Governor who had been suffered to remain but the Intendent only having fled is perfectly submissive to the will of the people. For several days last week the weather at the north side and in some of the Liguanea Mountains blew in most alarming gusts and the cold is said to have been peculiarly sever; some plantain trees have been thrown down but we have yet heard of no material damage. The sloop Resolution has brought into port a part of his Majesty's 10th regiment of foot consisting of a serjeant and 29 privates having received them from on board the ship Commerce Foot from London off the East End on Thursday last the Commerce being destined for Savanna la Mar. Dec. 26. Late on Thursday evening his Majesty's ship Amphion Captain Nichols returned to Port-Royal from the Spanish American coast. The Amphion was bound to Carthagena but was prevented by the jealousy of the Spaniards from entering that port. Accounts are said to be received by her that a revolt has taken place amongst the Indians in that quarter and that the Spaniards are demolishing the fortifications throughout the country which it has cost them so much labour and expence to raise; so appre hensive are they of the numbers and force of the malcontents should they possess themselves of any of those strong holds. We learn from Georgia that the treaty with the Indians to negotiate with Commissioners were appointed by the President of the United States has been broken off; and that Mr. M'Gillivray and his warriors have declared that nothing short of a cession of the territory between the rivers St. Mary and Altamaha will satisfy them; adding that no equivalent can be given to the Georgians for relinquishing their claim to the district in question as it is founded in usurpation. The views of Mr. M'Gillivray in making this requisition are evident as it is known that he wishes to establish a sea-port at St Mary's as well for thecommercial emolument as for the civilization of his countrymen by an intercourse with foreign States.  ID345,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,05,24,entertain,NOOTKA SOUND. The circumstances of thetrade and situation of this part of North America being a matter of such general conversation and great public moment we are particularly happy in being enabled to give some further account of the transactions that have happened at Nootka Sounds as well as to point out the advantages that were likely to be extended to other places by the means of this trade. It is necessary to remark that the skin of the sea otter is worn only in the Northern regions of China. Its fur though beautiful and magnificent is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of the Southern Provinces. Pekin is therefore the proper mart for this valuable commodity and in this immense city the consumption is so great that the produce of the voyage meets and immediate sale. The Mandarins of the Court and even the Emperor himself are fond of wearing this costly fur. To a citizen of common rank a sea otter's collar to his vestment is a luxury. The natives of the North West Coast of Ameerica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds that all the blankets cloths hats and stockings that could be procured in China if English manufacture were sold to the Indians with whose Chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed. An act of cruelty committed by an officer of the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to be recorded. The Spaniards discovering that Callicum a Chief second in authority at Nootka Sound was in alliance with the English he was shot through the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife of Callicum with an infant child escaped but not till wounded. Macquilla the Chief first in command retired at the head of the allies of England from Nootka Sound and to avoid the cruelty of the Spaniards they fled to distant parts. Such of the natives as they could seize the Spaniards condemned to work as slaves on their fortifications. At this period it was in the contemplation of the Spaniards to seize the Sandwich Islands with a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. And we further add on authority that amounts nearly to demonstration that on the very lands purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain Mears the Spaniards have already opened valuable mines. Another object of this enterprise wasto supply the markets of Kamschatka and other ports belonging to the Russians with the teas and other produce of China. This promised to be an invaluable channel of commerce as the Chinese have shut their ports against the Russians who On this voyage of discovery and experiment one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo but was unfortunately lost on her return to China. To these curious particulars we add with a patriot joy that the consumption of the glorious staple of England her broad cloths is astonishingly great in Japan and China: British hard ware &c. is also in great request. From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may depend on the utmost attention and civility. This Prince is six feet 4 1/2 inches high of proportionate bulk.  ID351,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,08,17,inform,By private letters and newspapers lately arrived from Philadelphia and New York we have informmation that the Indians are carrying on their depredations on the back settlements of the United States with great vigour; that an enquiry as to the miscarriage of the war had been made by Congress and an army was collected this year; that the Americans had some expectations of getting free of the Indian war by treaties. We have advices of Governor Clinton's being re-elected Governor of New York state by a majority of 180 but the friends of Mr. Tay were objecting to the return as the canvassers had not opened the boxes which contained the returns from three counties Otsego Clinton and Tioga which if opened they say would have given the election to Mr. Tay the county of Otsego alone being 300 majority in favours of Mr. Tay. A dreadful storm happened at New York on the 1st of July which continued with so much violence that several vessels were driven from their moorings and a number of boats upset and many lives lost.  ID365,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,08,30,persuade,Each day brings additional strength to the report of a rupture with America. The representtations which have been very forcibly urged by the American Minister Mr. Pickney include various topics of complaint. Amongst these are the withholding of the poste of Niagara Detroit &c. in violation of the treat of 1783; the exciting of of the Creek and other Indians to make compensation for the property seized by the armies under Lord Cornwalis & in the Southern States according to stipulation; the seizure of American ships bound to France; the impressing of American citizens to man our fleets; and finally the sullen silence which the British Minister is alledged to have uniformly maintained on the subject of the claims made by the Republic. The American Minister has however so little hope of efficacy from these representations that he has ordered in his tradesmen's bills and made every other preparation for an abrupt departure. Not withstanding this alarming aspect of affairs we still must hope that no consequences subversive of the pacific system at present subsisting between American and Great Britain will ensue; for ill-judged and ignorant indeed of the true interests of his country must that Briton be (whatever his rank) who would advise another American war –a war which reasoning of the future by the sorrowful experience of the past can only serve to increase the sum and to swell the catalogue of human woes.  ID369,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,01,11,inform,As the following Speech of Gen.

While on the one hand it awakened my gratitude for all those instances of affectionate partiality with which I have been honoured by my country; on the other it could not prevent an earnest wish for that retirement from which no private consideration should ever have torn me. But influenced by the belief that my conduct would be estimated according to its real motives; and that the people and the authorities derived from them would support exertions having nothing personal for their object I have obeyed the suffrage which commanded me to resume the executive power; and I humbly implore that Being on whose will the fate of nations depends to crown with success our mutual endeavors for the general happiness. As soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers with whom the United States have the most extensive relations there was reason to apprehend that our intercourse with them might be interrupted and our disposition for peace drawn into question by the suspicions too often entertained by belligerent nations. It seemed therefore to be my duty to admonish our citizens of the consequences of a contraband trade and of hostile acts to any of the parties; and to obtain by a declaration of the existing legal state of things an easier admission of our right to the immunities belonging to our situation. Under these impressions the proclamation which will be laid before you was issued. In this posture of affairs both new and delicate I resolved to adopt general rules which should conform to the treaties and assert the privileges of the United States. These were reduced into a system which will be communicated to you. Although I have not thought myself at liberty to forbid the sale of the prizes permitted by our treaty of commerce with France to be brought into our ports; I have not refused to cause them to be restored when they were taken within the protection of our territory or by vessels commissioned or equipped in a warlike form within the limits of the United States. It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct improve or enforce this plan of procedure; and it will probably be found expedient to extend the legal code and the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States to many cases which though dependent on principles already recognized demand some further provisions. Where individuals shall within the United States array themselves in hostility against any of the powers at war or enter upon military expeditions or enterprizes within the jurisdiction of the United States; or where the penalties on violations of the law of nations may have been indistinctly marked or are inadequate; those offenses cannot receive too early and close an attention and require prompt and decisive remedies. Whatsoever those remedies may be they will be well administered by the judiciary who possess a long-established course of investigation effectual process and officers in the habit of executing it. In like manner as several of the courts have doubted under particular circumstances their power to liberate the vessels of a nation at peace and even of a citizen of the United States although seized under a false colour of being hostile property; and have denied their power to liberate certain captures within the protection of our territory; it would seem proper to regulate their jurisdiction in these points. But if the executive is to be the resort in either of the two last mentioned cases it is hoped that he will be authorized by law to have facts ascertained by the courts when for his own information he shall request it. I can not recommend to your notice measures for the fulfillment of our duties to the rest of the world without again pressing upon you the necessity of placing ourselves in a condition of complete defense and of exacting from them the fulfillment of their duties toward us. The United States ought not to indulge a persuasion that contrary to the order of human events they will for ever keep at a distance those painful appeals to arms with which the history of every other nation abounds. There is a rank due to the United States among nations which will be withheld if not absolutely lost by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid insult we must be able to repel it; If we desire to secure peace one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity it must be known that we are at all times ready for war. The documents which will be presented to you will shew the amount and kinds of arms and military stores now in our magazines and arsenals; and yet an addition even to these supplies cannot with prudence be neglected as it would leave nothing to the uncertainty of procuring a warlike apparatus in the moment of public danger. Nor can such arrangements with such objects be exposed to the censure or jealousy of the warmest friends of Republican Government. They are incapable of abuse in the hands of the militia who ought to possess a pride in being the depository of the force of the Republic and may be trained to a degree of energy equal to every military exigency of the United States. But it is an enquiry which cannot be too solemnly pursued whether the act more effectually to provide for the national defense by establishing an uniform militia throughout the United States has organized them so as to produce their full effect; whether your own experience in the several States has not detected some imperfections in the scheme; and whether a material feature in an improvement of it ought not to be to afford an opportunity for the study of those branches of the military art which can scarcely ever be attained by practice alone. The connection of the United States with Europe has become extremely interesting. The occurrences which relate to it and have passed under the knowledge of the Executive will be exhibited to Congress in a subsequent communication. When we contemplate the war on our frontiers it may be truly affirmed that every reasonable effort has been made to adjust the causes of dissension with the Indians north of the Ohio. The instructions given to the Commissioners evince a moderation and equity; proceeding from a sincere love of peace and a liberality having no restriction but the essential interests and dignity of the United States. The attempt however of an amicable negotiation having been frustrated the troops have marched to act offensively. Although the proposed treaty did not arrest the progress of military preparation it is doubtful how far the advance of the season before good faith justified active movements may retard them during the remainder of the year. From the papers and intelligence which relate to this important subject you will determine whether the deficiency in the number of troops granted by law shall be compensated by succors of militia or additional encouragements shall be proposed to recruits. An anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Executive for peace with the Creeks and the Cherokees. The former have been relieved with corn and with clothing and offensive measures against them prohibited during the recess of Congress. To satisfy the complaints of the latter prosecutions have been instituted for the violences committed upon them. But the papers which will be delivered to you disclose the critical footing on which we stand in regard to both those tribes; and it is with Congress to pronounce what shall be done. After they shall have provided for the present emergency it will merit their most serious labours to render tranquillity with the savages permanent by creating ties of interest. Next to a rigorous execution of justice on the violators of peace the establishment of commerce with the Indian nations in behalf of the United States is most likely to conciliate their attachment. But it ought to be conducted without fraud without extortion; with constant and plentiful supplies; with a ready market for the commodities of the Indians and a stated price for what they give in payment and receive in exchange. Individuals will not pursue such a traffic unless they be allured by the hope of profit; but it will be enough for the United States to be reimbursed only. Should this recommendation accord with the opinion of Congress they will recollect that it can not be accomplished by any means yet in the hands of the Executive. GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The commissioners charged with the settlement of the accounts between the United and Individual States concluded their important function within the limited time by law; and the balances struck in their report which will be laid before congress have been placed on the books of the Treasury. On the 1st day of June last an installment of on million of florins became payable on the loans of the United States in Holland. This was adjusted by a prolongation of the period of reimbursement in nature of a new loan at an interest of five per cent. for the term of ten years; and the expenses of this operation were a commission of three per cent. The first installment of the loan of two millions of dollars from the Bank of the United States has been paid as was directed by law. For the second it is necessary that provision be made. No pecuniary consideration is more urgent than the redemption and discharge of the public debt: On none can delay be more injurious or an economy of time more valuable. The productiveness of the public revenues hitherto has continued to equal the anticipations which were formed of it; but it is not expected to prove commensurate with all the objects which have been suggested. Some auxiliary provisions will therefore it is presumed be requisite: and it is hoped that these may be made consistently with a due regard to the convenience of ourcitizens who can not but be sensible of the true wisdom of encountering a small present addition to their contributions to obviate a future accumulation of burdens. But here I can not forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the transportation of public prints. There is no resource so firm for the government of the United States as the affections of the People guided by an enlightened policy; and to this primary good nothing can conduce more than a faithful representation of public proceedings diffused without restraint throughout the United States. An estimate of the appropriations necessary for the current service of the ensuing year and a statement of a purchase of arms and military stores made during the recess will be presented to Congress. GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The several subjects to which I have now referred open a wide range to your deliberations and involve some of the choicest interests of our common country. Permit me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude of your task:–Without an unprejudiced coolness the welfare of the government may be hazarded; without harmony as far as consists with freedom of sentiment its dignity may be lost.–But as the legislative proceedings of the United States will never I trust be reproached for the want of temper or of candour so shall not the public happiness languish from the want of my strenuous and warmest cooperation. GEORGE WASHINGTON. Philadelphia Dec. 3 1793 The President having withdrawn the Members of the House of Representatives returned to their Chamber where the President's Address was read and referred to a Committee to report the draft of an answer. A Committee was then appointed to report the unfinished business of the last House.–Adjourned. Thursday Dec. 5. The Journal of the Commissioners for treating with the Indians was read. It is minute and lengthy. The definitive answer of the Indians contains their reasons for rejecting the proposals of the Commissioners drawn up in a masterly manner it bears all the appearance of EUropean logic faintly clad in an Indian dress. All the documents relative to this business were referred to a Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. A message was received from the President communication sundry papers relative to our European relations and also the result of the proceedings of the Commissioners appointed to settle the accounts of the United States with the Individual States. The first set of papers is introduced by a message of which the following is a copy: United States Dec. 5 1793 GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES As the present situations of the several nations of Europe and especially of those with whom the United States have important relations cannot but render the state of things between them and us; matter of interest ing enquiry to the Legislature and may indeed give rise to deliberations to which they alone are competent I have thought it my duty to communicate them certain correspondencies which have taken place. The Representatives and Executive Bodies of France have manifested generally a friendly attachment to this country; have given advantages to our commerce and navigation and have made overtures for placing these advantages on permanent ground; a decree however of the National Assembly subjecting vessels laden with provisions to be carried into their ports and making enemy goods lawful prize in the vessel of a friend contrary to our treaty though revoked at one time as to the United States has been since extended to their vessels also as has been recently stated to us. Representations on this subject will be immediately given in charge to our Minister there and the result shall be communicated to the Legislature. It is with extreme concern I have to inform you that the proceedings of the person whom they have unfortunately appointed their Minister Plenipotentiary here have breathed nothing of the friendly spirit of that nation which sent him; their tendency on the contrary has been to involve us in a war abroad; and discord and anarchy at home. So far as his acts or those of his agents have threatened our immediate commitment in the war or flagrant insult to the authority of the laws their effect has been counteracted by the ordinary cognizance of the laws and by an exertions of the powers confided to me. Where their danger was not imminent they have been born with from sentiments of regard to his nation from a sense of their friendship towards us from a conviction that they would not suffer us to remain long exposed to the action of a person who has so little respectedour mu tual dispositions and I will add from a reliance on the firmness of my fellow citizens in their principles of peace and order. In the mean time I have respected and pursued the stipulations of our treaties according to what I judge the true sense; and have withheld no act of friendship which their affairs have called for from us and which justice to others let us free to perform. I have gone further;–rather than employ force for the restitution of certain vessels which I deemed the United States bound to restore I thought it more advisable to satisfy the parties by avowing it to be my opinion that if restitution were not made it would be incumbent on the United States to make compensation. The papers now communicated will more particularly apprize you of these transactions. The vexations and spolitation understood to have been committed on our vessels and commerce by the cruizers and officers of some of the belligerent powers appeared to require attention. The proofs of these however not having been brought forward the description of citizens supposed to have suffered were notified that on furnishing them to the Executive Power due measures would be taken to obtain redress of the past and more effectual provisions against the future. Should such documents be furnished proper representations will be made thereon with a just resistance on a redress proportioned to eh exigency of the case. The BRitish Government having undertaken by orders to the commanders of their armed vessels to restrain generally our commerce in corn and other provisions to their own ports and those of their friends the instructions now communicated were immediately forwarded to our Minister at that court. In the mean time some discussionson the subject took place between him and them; these are also laid before you; and I may expect to learn the result of his special instructions in time to make it known to the legislature during their present sessions. Very early after the arrival of a British Minister here mutual explanation on the execution of the Treaty of Peace were entered into with that Minister; these are now laid before you for your information. On the subjects of mutual interest between this country and Spain negociations and conferences are now depending. The public requiring that the present state of those should be made known to the legislature in confidence only they shall be the subject of a separate and subsequent communication. G. WASHINGTON Mr. Madison reported the draft of an Answer to the Address of the President. The remainder of this sitting was employed in beginning the reading of the papers received from the President which are voluminous.
