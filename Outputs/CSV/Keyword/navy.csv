From the Hydra transport which put into Plymouth we have received the following official notification of Sir James Yeo's success on Lake Ontario the American notices of which have already been published. Bulletin. Head-quarters Kingston Aug. 14. 1813 By accounts received from his Excellency the Governor in Chief and Commander of the forces from Commodore Sir James Yeo dated off York half-past one P.M. on the 11th instant the following particulars have been transmitted of the capture and loss of the enemy's armed schooners:– On Thursday evening last the 10th instant the enemy's squadron under the Command of Commodore Chauncey got under weigh from their anchorage off the mouth of Niagara River and with a fine breeze from the east stood towards our fleet which were becalmed off the port of Twelve Mile Creek. At sun-set a breeze coming off the land gave us the wind of the enemy when our squadron stood for them on which immediately bore away from us under as much sail as their schooners could carry to keep up with their larger vessels. The enemy's fleet formed a long. The Pike Madison Oneida and six schooners (two schooners were placed to windward for the purpose of raking the masts of our squadron as it should come up). At eleven the squadron got within gun-shot of the schooners when they opened a brisk fire and from their going so fast it was more than an hour before the Wolf our headmost ship could pass them ; at this time the rest of the squadron was two and three miles astern of the Wolf and on her coming up with the Madison and Pike they put before the wind and made sail firing their stern-chasers.– Sir J. Yeo finding it impossible to get the squadron up with the enemy as the Wolf was the only ship which could keep up with them then made sail between them and the two schooners to windward which he captured and which are called the Julia and Growler each carrying one long 32pounder and long 12-pounder and 40 men.– Two of the enemy's largest schooners the Scourge of 10 and Hamilton of nine guns upset on the night of the 9th in carrying sail and all on board perished (about 100 in number). By this loss and capture the enemy's squadron are reduced to 10 vessels and our's increased to eight. It is ascertained that the Pike mounts 28 long 24-pounders and 420 men the Madison 22 long 32 pounders and 340 men. Boat loads of troops were taken on board the enemy's squadron on Monday last for the purpose it is supposed of repelling the boarders.– The Wolf has not received any material injury and not a person hurt. The prisoners were landed on the 11th instant and the Growler's damage repaired. She had lost her bowsprit and was otherwise cut up. Nothing could exceed the eagerness and enthusiasm of the officers and men in our squadron for a close engagement.  ID109,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1813,10,07,inform,(From the Quebec Mercury.) Attack on Fort Schlosser. Head-quarters Kingston July 13. By accounts from the army under Major-General De Rottenburg dated the 9th instant the following particulars have been received of a bold and successful attempt to surprise the American post at Fort Schlosser. In the night of the 4th instant a party consisting of Volunteer Thompson and six privates of the 49th regiment under Ensign Winder and thirty-four of the militia the whole under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Clarke of the Lincoln militia crossed over in boats from Chippawa to Fort Schlosser which they reached a little before day-break and completely surprised the guard consisting of two Lieutenants one serjeant and eight privates whom they made prisoners together with three civilians and three of our own subjects found in the Fort.– The party remained in the Fort about one hour loading their boats form the public stores and wharf and brought with them one brass six-pounder 57 stand of arms two and a half kegs of musket ball cartridges 6 bulwarks of musket proof curtains for boats one gun-boat two batteaux 20 barrels of salt 17 casks tobacco eight barrels of pork and one barrel of whiskey with a number of spades oars and axes ; a small party of the enemy had collected as the last boast pushed off from the shore and several shots were fired but the boats returned to Chippawa with their prisoners and the articles they had captured without a man being hurt on this service. Further accounts have also been received from the army highly creditable to the Indian warriors serving with it. On the 8th instant a party of the King's regiment and a body of Indian warriors were sent to endeavour to recover a considerable quantity of medicines and surgical instruments which had been buried near the Fort George when our troops retired from it. A skirmish ensued in consequence between the Indians and the enemy in which the latter lost one officer and 20 men killed and 10 taken prisoners–the whole of the medicines and instruments were brought off by the party of the King's; the only loss sustained being three Indians wounded. Captain Norton led the Indian warriors with great spirit ; and much credit is due to Captain Merrit of the Provincial dragoons for reconnoitering the spot where the medicines were deposited and conducting the party to it. A few nights ago the barracks at Gravelly Point burnt by our gun-boats and more than 100 barrels of pork flour and other articles brought away from thence together with a very fine Durham boat–500 oars colleced and partly loaded in her for Sacket's Harbour being destroyed. Attack on Black Rock Head-quarters Kingston July 15 1813. G. O.–His Excellency the Commander of the forces has received a dispatch from Major General De Rottenburg reporting a successful attack upon the enemy's post and dockyard at Black Rock at daybreak on the morning of the 11th inst. by detachments of the King's and 41st regiments together with Liutenant Fitzgibbon's party of the 49th and about 40 militia the whole amounting to 240 men under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp. The enemy's position was carried by a spirited attack without the loss of a single man. Several large boats loaded with stores and provisions and three field pieces a twelve and two six-pounders were brought away ; a vessel and all the naval store-houses and barracks have been burnt. Unfortunately before the evacuation of the post was completed a strong reinforcement of the enemy aided by Indians pressed this small detachment by which Captain Saunders of the 41st and 15 men were killed ; Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp Lieutenant Montpesson of the 41st and 15 rank and file wound ed. The wounded were brought over. Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp has received three wounds severe but not considered dangerous. By his Excellency's command Edward Baynes Adjutant-General British Expedition to Plattsburgh The following is an extract of a letter from a respectable citizen at Burlington dated Aug. 1. 1813 An express arrived at Burlington on the 30th July with intelligence that the British had left the Isle au Noix with a force consisting of the two armed sloops of 11 guns each and four gallies of one gun each and 100 batteaux full of men and had progressed within one mile of the town. The camp was instantly alarmed and the troops under arms but no enemy appeared. Next day we learnt that about 1000 troops under the command of Colonel Murray had landed and took possession of Plattsburgh without opposition there being no force to oppose them except the militia of the town and vicinity who being only 400 in number retreated as the enemy advanced. The arsenal belonging to the State Pike's encampment barracks at Serenac cantonment and every building belonging to the United States were immediately burnt. The enemy obtained both provisions and stores. The loss cannot be less than 50000 dollars. The enemy left Plattsburgh on the 1st and are understood to be proceeding this way ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? On General Dearborn invading Canada and taking possession of Fort George he sent off to Greenbush as prisoners of war the following respectable inhabitants : Messrs Edwards Murehead Dickson Lyminston Lawe two Kerrs M'Ewan Parson Addison Howell Heron Green Baldwin Clinch Jones Ball Decoe and John Crook. Messrs Lawe M'Ewen and the two Kerrs were wounded on the 27th June. General Dearborn expected that the inhabitants would have joined the Americans. General Dearborn resigned the command of the Niagara army on the 23th June on account of indisposition. General Lewis says in his dispatch to Secretary at War that he did not think the General would ever again be fit for service ; that the unfortunate events of the war had deranged his understanding ; and that thought sometimes in a state of convalescence he uniformly relapsed when military topics were alluded to. General Lewis having been nominated to command at Sacket's Harbour is succeeded at Fort George Niagara and on the Canadian frontier by General Boyd. The Indian chief Tecumseh has seized the favourable moment of the diversion by our shipping in Virginia for surround Fort Meigs with 2000 warriors. He had deprived the garrison of all the possibility of receiving supplies. General Clay who commanded there had written urgently to General Harrison for assistance. The latter was collecting his army to march to his relief. Sir James Yeo after the retreat of the enemy's army at Fort George swept the American side of Lake Ontario. He landed a body of troops at Great Sodus and took the whole of the provisions consisting of several hundred barrels of pork and flour and burnt the buildings. The British loss was a serjeant and four privates of the Royal killed. At Genessee River he inflicted the same loss on the enemy taking 500 barrels of pork and 1700 bushels of corn. The provisions were delivered to General Vincent. Four companies of the Royals were embarked on board the fleet to serve as mariners There were at Quebec on the 22d July 1000 American prisoners of war captured since the commencement of the campaign. At Beaufort there were 50 officers including three General. In consequence of the conduct of the American Government and of the officers the latter are no longer permitted to return home on parole. The Melpomene frigate with De Meuron's regiment from the Mediterranean arrived in the river St. Lawrence on the 20th July. James Gready private in the 8th or King's regiment and Terence Hunt private in the 6th foot were in the latter end of June tried by Court Martials for deserting to the enemy and being found in arms and were publicy shot at Kingston Canada pursuant to their sentence. It appears from the Quebec papers and from the general orders issued by the Commander in Chief in Canada that on the late defeat of General Wilkinson on the banks of the Miami river the American military chest containing 15000l. Sterling was among the property captured by the British. Captain Waugh of the 103d regiment died at Chamely on the 2d July. General Hampton has arrested Colonel Clark the late commandant at Burlington for a defalcation of about 50000 dollars.  ID114,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1814,10,15,inform,Quebec Sept. 10. The Americans to the number of 900 men landed and at tacked Fort Michillimackinac in Lake Huron on the 4th August. They were repulsed by the British garrison. The American fort la Prairie du Chiens has been taken by the British. This place was considered as of great importance to the enemy. Major General Conran of the Royal has had the misfortune to break his leg by a fall from his horse. This officer had just arrived to join the army on the Niagara frontier when he met with this accident. On the 31st August the British troops broke their encampment at Odell Town near Lake Champlain and proceeded immediately to take possession of the position which the American army had just abandoned at the village of Champlain. This army was commanded by General Izard and are said to have proceeded partly to Plattsburgh and partly to Sackett's Harbour on Lake Ontario. The British troops now at Champlain are commanded by Major Gene rals Brisbane Power and Robinson and consist of the 13th 49 88th Meuron's regiment Canadian chasseurs &c. &c. The 79th[?] or [?] Glasgow Lowland regiment are now quartered at Cornwall in Upper Canada. The 4th[?] battalion of the 1st or Royal Scots are stationed at Quebec. The 3rd[?] 104th flank[?] companies 103d 8th or King's 100th regiment de Watteville [?] battalion of 1st or Royal Scots and 41st flank[?] companies are with the army under Lieutenant General Drummon on the Niagara frontier Upper Canada. The 37th and 57th regiments are at Montreal. On the 15th of August the British troops under Lieutenant General Drummond assaulted Fort Erie. The attack was made in three columns under Colonel Scott of the 103d regiment Lieutenant Colonel Drummond 104th regiment and Lieutenant Colonel Fischer of de Watteville's. The two former were directed to scale the fort and the latter to get possession of a small hill named Snake-Hill which the Americans had fortified and being situated only about eight hundred yards from Fort Erie was of consequence to us. This latter column failed in their object ; but the two columns destined for the fort carried the same in a most gallant manner and obliged the enemy to retire into two stone block-houses inside the fort when their own guns were turned against them. At this time a most unfortunate explosion took place which blew up the magazine and battery and with them a number of our brave soldiers ; and the consternation caused by this was so great and we were obliged to abandon our conquest and retreat to our original position with great loss of both officers and men. The large ship-building by the British at Kingston on Lake Ontario is to be launched the second week in September– also will carry about 100 guns. The battalion of royal marines commanded by LieutenantColonel Williams and which has been stationed lately at Isle au Noix and parts adjacent have been broken up and distributed among the fleets on the Lakes. The Staff of the battalion proceed immediately to Halifax from Quebec in the Ceylong armed-en [?] ship. The Junon frigate Captain Upton has arrived from Halifax at Quebec with money for Government. The crew of this vessel is to be employed on the Lakes. A brig which sailed from Cork under convoy of the Antelope of 50 guns has arrived at Quebec.–The Antelope and the ships under convoy are hourly expected. It is said that there are on board the ships of the latter about 4000 troops chiefly detachments and reinforcements for the regimentsin Canada. Captain Dowale of the royal navy now commands the fleet on Lake Champlain.  ID251,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1835,09,16,inform,On Thursday evening a dinner was given to Captain Hindmarsh R.N. to celebrate the circumstance of his Majesty having graciously expressed his approbation of the choice of that gentleman to be the Governor of the new colony in South Australia. The entertainment took place at the Albion Tavern.  ID340,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,06,21,inform,The brig Virginia Planter James Merrifield Master arrived at Liverpool brings information that on the 5th of May General Wayne with two thousand provincials had attacked totally destroyed most of the Indian towns at the back of Georgia for near two hundred miles around the river. That M'Gilvray and his army of savages after an unsuccessful and bloody engagement had fled to the woods where the General left them and returned to Savannah.– This expedition was undertaken about the beginning of March winch has been crowned with the expected catastrophe and though the Cherokee Miami and Chiquesaw tribes may mediate revenge at some future period; it is not likely they will be in a condition to disturb the settlers for some years to come.  ID97,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,09,12,entertain,The laws of the State of Pennsylvania and that of Massachusetts by which the punishment of death is abolished in all cases except for wilful murder are about to be adopted by the respective Legislatures of all the other States. The system of the great and merciful???caria has taken place of the sanguinary Penal laws of England. The abolition of Negro slavery which has taken shape in the five New England States of New Hampshire Massachusets Rhode island Connecticut and Vermont; in the Midland States of New York New Jersey Pennsylvania and Delawar; and in the Western State of Kentucky for several years past is now extended by act of Congress to the Southern States of Virginia North Carolina South Carolina Georgia and Maryland; and the emancipation of the remainder of that unfortunate race of men is to take place on or before the fifth of November 1795. The Legislature of the State of Massachusetts has g???ed a part of the public lands to the emancipated Negroes of that State in proportion to the numbers of the respective families where the liberal and philanthropic mind is gratified by seeing them erect villages cultivate farms and form communities of civilized Societies. Before the Gentleman who has favoured us with this Intelligence left America they had established a Lodge of Masonry; and he had the satisfaction of seeing them on a grand day parade to Church in all the magnificence of the Order where a sermon was preached on the occasion by one of their own colour. They have also endowed public schools employed??? and erected places of Public Worship. The Officers Non-commissioned Officers and Soldiers who served in the Continental army and established the Liberty of their Country have at last received a reward infinitely beyond their expectations but every way corresponding with the liberty of a great and rising Republic. Five hundred acres of land have been voted by Congress this last Session to each individual who served throughout the war; and to the defendants of those who fell in contending for the Rights of Nature and eequal proportion to those who served for a shorter period; and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real value to the injury of the Patriotic Veteran as has been the case of former grants he is allowed his option of taking its value in sterling money at the present market price from the Treasure of the States; or any part in land and the rest in moneya s may be most agreeable to the receiver. The Mint of the United States which was established two years since has begun to issue its hold and silver coin: the copper has been delivered some time. The gold coins are eagles half eagles and quarter eagles. The first is exactly five and forty shillings English money or ten American coin. The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half and quater which makes the courie of exchange simple and suits the reckoning to a very capacity–as our Readers will perceive that ten quarter dollars make the quarter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle; and ten dollars the eagle. There is besides one more silver coin which is called a Dime and is the tenth part of a dollar. The copper coin is called a Cent and is the tenth part of a Dime. Six of the ships of war which were voted by Congress in November last are completed and put in commission: the remaining twenty four will be ready by Midsummer next and will complete a fleet of??? hundred guns. The city of Washington which in five years more will be the Capital of the United States will in every respect be the first in the world: the Capitol or Congress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence and c??? a full and complete view of every part of the city as well as a considerable extent of the country around. The President's house likewise stands upon a rising ground near the banks of the Potamac possessing a delightful water prospect together with a commanding view of the Capitol and some other material parts of the city. From the President's house to the Capitol run two great pleasure parks or malls which intersect and terminate upon the banks of the Potomac and are ornamented at the sides by elegant buildings for Foreign Ministers. The four fronts of the Capitol as well as those of the President's house are of the finest marble. The building of these superb edifices has been much retarded by the want of stone cutters masons bricklayers carpenters and blacksmiths who at this time actually receive the enormous wages of ten shillings American currency per day. The district of Country at the back of North Carolina reaching to the Mississippi and covering a country six hundred miles long by three hundred broad is next winter to be formed into a Sixteenth State; and the Province of Maine extending from the borders of New Hampshire to the river St. Croix is expected to form a Seventeenth. The new cities build in America since her independence are Grenville in the State of Georgia; Martenberg the Capitol of North Carolina; Columbia the Capital of South Carolina; Noxville and Nashville in the Tenesee Settlements; Danville Fairfield and Lex ington in the State of Kentucky; Washington the Capital of the United States; Sunbury in the State of Pennsylvania; Hudson upon Husdon's River and Cooper's Town in the State of New York; Bennington in the State of Vermont; and Paterson in the State of New Jersey. All the towns burnt by the English in the was have been rebuilt and the old cities of Charlestown Baltimore Philadelphia New York and Boston have been extended to more than double the extent they had before the peace. The population of the United States by the last Census in 1790 was more than double what it was in 1775 by which it appears that America doubles her number of people every fifteen years. The emigrations from the different nations in Europe to that country are esimated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually. The increase of farms and villages has been so great as to people four new States and to extend their Settlements from the Atlantic to the Ohio in the South and from the Atlantic to the Lakes on the River St. Lawrence in the North.
