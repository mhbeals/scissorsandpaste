Halifax March 13. A very numerous and respectable meeting of the inhabitants of this town was held at the Exchange Coffeehouse on Saturday last George Grassie. Esq. to the Chair. It was resolved unaminously–That the Legislature be petitioned to authorise the establishment of a bank in Halifax.–That 50000l be the capital to be invested in the British funds.–That notes to the amount of 150000l be issued by the Bank.–That the shares be 100l each and every five shares according to a classification entitled to a vote.–That the Bank be authorised to pay notes presented either in specie provincial paper or bills of exchange on London at the current rate – A Committee was then appointed to prepare the Petition and cause it to be presetned to the Legislature. The gentlemen present immediately afterwards unanimously agreed to give to the doubloun the value of 4l and to the sovereigh the value 1l 2s. 6d. currency. The meeting then adjourned. York Upper Canada Feb. 6. Tex v. The Earl of Selkirk and others A bill of indictment for a conspiracy to ruin the trade of the North West Company and impoverish the partnes thereof was found by the Grand Jury against Thomas Douglas Early of Selkirk ; J. B. Chevalier de Lorimer Captain in his Majesty's Indian Department ; Captain Pratais D'Orsonnens late of the De Meuron Regiment ; Captain Frederick Matthey ditto ; Lieutenant G. A. Fauche ditto ; Lieutenant Frederick Graffenrad ditto ; Serjeant Jacob Vichie ditto ; Captain Miles Macdonnel late of the Canadian Fecibles ; Lieutenant Alexander Bridport Beecher late of the Royal Navy ; Doctor John Allen John Spencer Donald Macpherson James Chatelain John M'Nab Archibald Macdonald and John P. Bourke. The indictment contains three counts ; and amongst the numerous overt acts therein set forth supported by documentary and oral evidence the following were particularly prominent :– The engaging and armind a number of disbanded soldiers (foreigners) ; the entry of them by force of arms into Fort William in August 1816 ; retaining possession of the fort till May 1817 ; sending off as prisoners the partners of the North West Company found there ; getting rid of the clerks by subpoenas to appear at York at a period when no courts are held there without ever inquiring whether they know anything of the matters to which the subpoenas related and without ever bringing them forward afterwards ; stopping of the outfits from going into the interior and the returns from coming into Montreal ; possessing themselves of all the books and papers of the concern ; sending away the principal clerk under a charge of felony without examination and without having ever followed up the charge ; the pretended sale by Daniel Mackenzie of the North West property obtained by his Lordship by means of continued duress ; tampering with and debauching the North West Company's servants and commanding them in the King's name ; writing circular letters to the partners and clerks in the interior country advising them to abandon their trust alleging that the North West Company were ruined and to carry the furs to Hudson's Bay ; taking possession of Fort Lake La Pluie and the property there and stopping the navigation &c &c. Upon this being returned a true bill the AttorneyGeneral moved the process of the Court against the parties ; and Dr Allen being present was to be arraigned the following day. Wm Smith v. The Earl of Selkirk This was a civil action brough by Mr Wm Smith against Lord Selkirk for false imprisonment. It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff was undersheriff of the Western District and as such the bearer of a writ of restitution founded upon a verdict of a special jury at Sandwich in October 1816 and granted by the Magistrate ordering the restoration of Fort William to the North West Company. He was also the bearer of a warrant for felony issued against his Lordship Dr Allen Captain Matthey and others upon an information upon oath before a justice of the Peace. Mr Smith got to Fort William on the 19th of March 1817 and produced his writ of restitution with which his Lordship refused to comply ; and when the Earl and others were arrested by Mr Smith upon the warrant for felony his Lordship laid hold of him and pushed him out of doors ; and he was afterwards kept in close custody in the fort under a military guard. A circumstance which added much to the grievous nature of the offence and which was particularly dwelt upon by the Judge in his charge to the Jury was that whilst Mr Smith was kept in a rigorous confinement Charles de Reinhard though under an accusation of was at large and keeping a school though nominally under the surveillance of one or two of his former comrades. The Chief Justice also remarked upon another part of the evidence for the defence by which it appeared that the only option left to Mr Smith to obtain his liberty was that of abandoning his duty and breaking his oath of office by a promise not to molest Lord Selkirk. Mr Smith however notwithstanding this proposal persisted in doing his duty and was not liberated until the evacuation of Fort William by his Lordship and his forces in May 1818. The Jury after some deliberation returned a verdict in favour of the plaintiff.– Damages L.500 Halifax currency. After narrating the military parages &c. at Richmond in America in honour of the 22d of February a journal says A melancholy catastrophe closed the day. Colonel W. Tatham so well known in England and this country for his acquaintance with civil engineering.–who has been residing in this city for two or three years but whose utility was considerably arrested by an unfortunate habit to which he had become addicted–was destined on that day to breathe his last.– In a moment of intemperance as he stood by the piece of artillery which was firing the evening salute he exclaimed that he wished to die. As the second gun was about to fire and immediately after the commanding had given the word Fire! Conolonel Tatham presented himself in front of the muzzle of the piece and by its discharge his abdomen was almost literally blown to pieces. His body was raised a few feet in the air by the explosion and he fell upon his face without uttering one word that was heard by the byestanders.– Colonel Tatham died without any family. Circumstances had strip life of much of its attractions in his eyes ; but it is impossible not to regard the manner of his death with horroer and to feel the deepest commiseraton for his melancholy fate. He was a man of great information of great genius and of great resource of mine. But to this melancholy end he has arrived.  ID257,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1836,04,09,inform,Sir George Clerk. –As the cawing of the rooks portends a storm it is worth while to mention that the cunning baronet has come down from London and commenced a canvass in this county within these few days. It is stated we believe upon good authority that he accounts for this course of proceeding by referring to the great probability of the Lords throwing out the Irish Municipal Bill. Burn's Monument. –We understand that there is now an early prospect of the completion of this monument which has too long remained in an unfinished state to the surprise of strangers and the discredit to our Modern Athens. The sum already in the Treasurer's hands aided by the profits of the handsome musical work lately issued by Mr M'Leod which he has generously devoted to that purpose is now nearly sufficient to meet the calculations of the expense requird for the railing in and decoration of the ground around the monument. We expect therefore that the work will forthwith be commenced and if a few pounds are still wanted we have no doubt there are hundreds in Edinburgh who would willingly guarantee the Treasurer against any loss by the immediate completion of the undertaking. Annuity Tax. –We understand that deputations from several places in the country are expected to attend the public meeting which is to be held on Tuesday evening for the purpose of petitioning Parliament for the abolition of the Annuity Tax in order to testify their abhorrence of that system of politico Christianity which requires distraint and imprisonment for its support. We observe that Mr Gillon of Wallhouse M.P. is to take the chair. The meeting we doubt not will be most numerously attended. Law of Scotland. –The prizes given by Professor Bell for the greatest proficiency in the examinations were yesterday awarded to Mr William Neish 25 India Street in the senior and to William Spence 31 Broughton Place in the junior class. The following gentlemen also distinguished themselves in the competition : Mr John Fraser James Gilchrist James Mason James Scott in the senior class; James Oliver David Gale John R. Banks James Charles Murray Wm. M'Naughton in the junior. Kilwinning March 30.–The United Associate Presbytery of Kilmarnock met at Kilwinning on Tuesday the 22d March and ordained Mr A. Macgregor to the pastoral charge of the congregation in that place. The Rev. D. Henderson of Dalry preached and presided. The Rev. Mr Cairns of Stewarton ordained and the Rev D. Ronald of Saltcoats gave the charge to the minister and congregation. On the Sabbath following the Rev. Mr Tait of Barrhead introduced Mr Macgregor to his congregation ; and there is every prospect that the hitherto long disappointed congregation of Kilwinning will now prosper under the pastoral care of their much esteemed and highly talented young minister. Presentation of Plate. –Mr A. S. Walker late of the Commercial Bank of Scotland at present manager of the branch of the Commercial Bank of England at Uttoxeter in Staffordshire was lately presented with an elegant tea service by the proprietors of that establishment bearing the following inscription :– Presented to Mr Archibald S. Walker by the Uttoxeter Proprietors of the Commercial Bank of England as a small acknowledgement of his faithful and valuable services–March 1836. This is another proof of the estimation in which many of the young men are held who have been trained to the banking system in this country. From a Return just published we find that the emigration to Canada has been comparatively small last year. The whole number of emigrants landed at Quebec and Montreal in 1835 was 12527 : in 1831 and 1832 four times and in 1834 two times as many were sent out. Of the 12527 there were 5597 adult males 3866 females and 3064 children under 14 years. Of the whole number 1043 were sent out by parochial aid. The numbers from the three kingdoms were– England 3067 Ireland 7108 Scotland 2127 From Newfoundland Nova Scotia &c. 225 Settled in Lower Canada 2297 Upper Canada 9800 Died at Grosse Isle and Quebec 13 Returned to the United Kingdom 117 Removed to the United States 300 –12527 But besides those who went to Canada 16749 landed at New York raising the whole number of emigrants to 29376. There were no less than three vessels wrecked last year on their way to Quebec– the William Ewing from Londonderry with 300 passengers all saved–the barque James from Newfoundland all saved–and the Nathaniel Graham from Cork with 48 persons on board passengers and crew of whom 41 were lost. From another part of the Report we find that 2764 female emigrants were sent out to Australia last year under the superintendence of the Emigration Committee. Of these 2105 had a free passage. The arrangements seem to have been ood ; for the mortality was small and few complaints were made. The females were all of decent character and due care was taken on their arrival to get them disposed of as servants in situations where their morals would not be exposed to unnecessary risk. Ulster Railway. –Length 36 miles from Belfast to Armagh ; capital t600000 in 12000 shares of which t393000 are subscribed. The number of passengers expected is 450000; the expected income is t93000 of which t67800 is from passengers ; the estimated expense of the work is t539000. The steepest gradient is 1 in 200. There are 3 tunnels of 310 320 and 570 yards in length. East Lothian Railway. –We call attention with great pleasure to the Prospectus of a railway from Dunbar to Edinburgh by Haddington and Tranent which appears in our first page. No one can have travelled over the ground without observing how admirably it is fitted for this species of communication by its remarkable uniformity of surface. We should have doubted whether such a work would pay had it terminated at Edinburgh ; but as a part of an unbroken line reaching across the most fertile and populous parts of Scotland from the German ocean to the Atlantic its chances of success are vastly increased. Dundee and Arbroath Railway. –The Committee's report on this railway has reached us but we must confine ourselves to an abstract. The length is 16 miles 5 furlongs and 90 yards ; the capital t100000 divided into 4000 shares which is all subscribed but authority is taken to raise t40000 more by loan ; sum paid up t5000 ; subscribed by shareholders locally interested t88900 by others t7150 : there are three subscribers for t2000 and upwards : the expected income from passengers is t16912 goods t14654 from both t31566. There are no tunnels no inclined planes and the steepest gradient being only 1 in 1000 scarcely differs from a dead level. It does not cross any highway or turnpike on a level. The estimated expenses is t99844. Statute Labour Acts. –It appears from the votes of the House of Commons that a Select Committee has been appointed to investigate the Scottish Statute Labour Acts and to consider what amendments may be made thereon. It may be stated that by the present act for this county proprietors of land and several other descriptions of people are totally exempted from any burden on account of the coaches chaises gigs or saddle horses they may keep though it is quite plain good roads are of as much advantage to them as to the occupiers of land upon whom almost the sole burden is thrown. In many parishes a considerable addition would be made to the road funds were no such exemptions allowed. At present the management is vested in heritors rated at one hundred pounds Scots and upwards though it is stated with confidence that were the occupiers of land included beneficial consequences would follow.– East- Lothian Correspondent. Leith Mechanics' Friendly Assurance Society. – The fifth annual meeting of this Institution was held on Tuesday last–John Hutton Esq. one of the Honorary Members President of the Society in the chair. A very satisfactory report for the last year was read and thanks were voted to the different Office bearers. It appears that this society was established under the countenance of the Magistrates and Ministers and various influential individuals in Leith and is well deserving of encouragement as affording the benefits of mutual insurance to the working classes the lowest rates consistent with perfect security. The funds we understand are in a prosperous state. Hay and Straw. –In consequence of it having been alleged last Wednesday that higher prices were got for straw than those quoted we have made due inquiry and find there are no grounds for such an allegation. We have been further assured that in reporting the prices of hay and straw for these two years past the clerk of the corn market has never shown a desire to favour the farm servants at the expense of their employers or to favour either party at the expense of the public. The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have been pleased to grant by their warrant dated the 6th of April 1836 a distinguishing flag to be worn by the respective vessels belonging to the Eastern Regatta Club of Scotland viz. a blue cornet flag with a white St Andrew's cross on the upper quarter on a red field. Heriot's Hospital. –At the meeting of the Governors of George Heriot's Hospital on Thursday the 7th instant the estimate of Messrs Trotter for alterations and repairs on the chapel amounting to t935 was accepted and it will gratify the friends of economy to learn that this is t65 under the sum voted by a majority of the Governors for that purpose some time ago. Thereafter a unanimous vote of thanks was passed to Councillor Gillespie Graham for gratuitously furnishing a plan of the intended improvements on the chapel which was described by Councillor Grant and others as highly creditable to the skill and good taste of that distinguished architect. The Governors then proceeded to consider the list of applications for admission of boys preparatory to the usual half-yearly election. There were 16 vacancies and 37 applicants who may be thus classed :– Those who have never received benefit from George Heriot's Hospital or any other institution 12 Those who have received benefit for one child 13 Do. for two children 6 Do. for three children 5 Do. for five children 1 37 In considering cases the present practise of the Governors is to give preference first to children of widows (being poor) then to those who have never received benefit afterwards those who have had only one child in and so on. These were but three applications for widow's children and one for an orphan out of the above number and it is therefore probable considering the large population of Edinburgh that it is not sufficiently known that George Heriot in his will expressly points out the fatherless and poor being children of burgesses and freemen as the objects of his charity–hence if there be not a sufficient numbers of really necessitous cases the Governors in filling up the vacancies may elect some that do not appear to have strong claims simply from those that have such claims not coming forward in sufficient numbers. Political Economy. –On Thursday last the course of lectures on Political Economy delivered by Dr Thomas Murray in Elder Street Chapel was brought to a conclusion ; on which occasion the thanks of the meeting were on the motion of one of the members of committe voted by acclamation to the lecturer for his valuable services. After thanks had been returned by Dr Murray Mr A. G. Hunter merchant was called to the Chair and some conversation having taken place the committee of management who had necessarily been self-elected were confirmed by the meeting in their office and empowered to take such steps as they might think expedient for obtaining lectures to the industrious classes next winter. We understand that Dr Murray is to be entertained at supper some evening next week on the occasion of being presented with a piece of silver plate. It is with much regret we learn that John Grieve Esq. of Newington Cottage died on Monday last. He was beloved and esteemed for his estimable qualities by all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance and his death will be long and deeply regretted. Rare Sights in London. –A young Scottish Miss who had voyaged the length of London on a pleasure jaunt returned the other day by one of the steamers and was met on landing by various members of her family who anxiously inquired what she had seen in London. Seen ! exclaimed the fair tourist I have seen such sights ! I saw the Theological Garden and all the wild beasts in't! The Theatre.–Mr C. Kean concluded his engagement on Thursday evening–an engagement the longest and most brilliant of any that our Theatre has witnessed for many years. Mr Kean has been with us for a whole month and has succeeded in crowding the house almost every night. We understand that upwards of 30000 persons have visited the theatre during his engagement–a number beyond that of any former period of equal duration. In that time he has appeared in some of the most arduous and difficult of Shakespeare's characters Hamlet Richard Macbeth Othello Shylock and King John investing each with its own peculiar charms and interest and exciting the highest admiration and astonishment at the versatility and power of his genius which could give such individuality and truth to so many dissimilar distinct and separate classes of characters. The play with which his engagement concluded was Richard which character he has performed seven times during his engagement ; the house was as usual crowded in every part and he exerted himself most strenuously and successfully. At the conclusion the cheers of the audience were loud and long and two laurel wreaths were thrown upon the stage from different parts of the house. Mr K. being loudly called for appeared in front of the stage and delivered the following very neat and appropriate address:– Ladies and Gentlemen –I now stand before you for the last time this season but believe me whichever way my pilgrimage may bend my thoughts will ever recur to Edinburgh as those of a child to its distant home fondly anticipating the hour when he shall again stand upon its threshold. (Great cheering.) Till that period permit me with a heavy but a grateful heart to pronounce that melancholy word– farewell. (Mr Kean then withdrew amidst reiterated and enthusiastic plaudits from all parts of the house.) –Mr K. we perceive appears next in Aberdeen where the people are anticipating a rich treat from his performances. The boxes there we are told are already taken for several successive nights to come.– Mrs Honey from the Theatre Royal Haymarket makes her appearance here on Monday first. On Wednesday evening Mr John G. Moxey baker Castle Street was entertained at supper in Menzie's Hotel and Tavern Waterloo Place by a party of friends of about fifty in number previous to his leaving this country for America to which he is about to emigrate. The company was very harmonious and the compliment must have been very gratifying to Mr Moxey. Qualifications of General Assembly Elders. –The Presbytery of Cupar at their meeting on the 29th ult. elected the Earl of Leven and Melville and Walter Malcolm Esq. Edinburgh to represent them in the ensuing Assembly. Mr Malcolm is factor for Captain Hay of Mugdrum who is principal heritor in the parish of Newburgh and was lately ordained an elder there. Against his election to serve in the Assembly a protest and appeal were taken on the grounds as we understand that he has no domicile within the bounds of Presbytery and is not an officiating elder; the protesters allowing that his election though consistent with the letter is contrary to the spirit of an act of Assembly passed in 1816. If the appeal is sustained it is evident that a large proportion of the Assembly elders must vacate their seats. Intimation also was given by D. Maitland M'Gill Esq. that when the commissions came to be attested he would move for evidence being produced that the elders-elect maintain family worship. An amusing inquiry was instituted in the Presbytery last year respecting the Earl of Leven's habits of domestic devotion ; and a clerical member had the candour to say he should wish to know how it was with the ministers themselves in that respect. The University of St Andrews has just conferred the degree of Doctor of Divinity on the Rev. Professor Paxton of Edinburgh. In bestowing this public honour on one who during a long and useful life has done so much for the cause of literature and religion the members of the College have done an act which shows that they can appreciate real merit and which will entitle them to the gratitude of the religious public of Scotland. Those who have had the good fortune to enjoy the public ministrations of Professor Paxton and even the general church-going community are well aware of the rich and glowing eloquence of the pious and heartfelt warmth and of the classical elegance which have long characterised his public preaching. Even beyond the religious body of which he is the ornament he is well known as one of the most popular and impressive teachers of the day. In his lectures on Theology as Professor to the General Associate Synod and afterwards to the Associate Synod he displayed the results of an extensive and profound critical study of the Scriptures and of an unwearied research into the Natural History and the manners and usages of the ancients nations. The work by which he is chiefly known as an author– The Illustrations of Scripture –will long bear testimony to the extent of his learning and of his Oriental investigations and to his powers of lucid and eloquent composition. We understand that the attention of the College was directed to Mr Paxton's merits by the distinguished Professor of Oriental Languages. This anxiety to do justice to a fellow labourer in the same field of study reflects high honour on the discrimination and the heart of Mr Tennant. Public Dinner to Professor Dick. –On Tuesday last the Students ofthe Edinburgh Veterinary College and a number of Veterinary Surgeons and other gentlemen (in all upwards of 70) from various parts of Scotland entertained Professor Dick to a public dinner in the Waterloo Hotel. John Lambert Esq. in the Chair and Alexander Gordon jun Esq. croupier. The stewards were Ed. Pyper Esq. of West Craigs J. R. Laing Esq. jun of Dunkenny Samuel Wordsworth jun. Esq. W.S. Dr Malcolm James Miller Esq. and George Rennie Esq.– Amongst the gentlemen present we observed Professors Low and Lizars ; Drs Robertson Spittal Knox and Aitken Mr Ferguson surgeon ; J. B. Murdoch Esq. of Coldoch; Charles Gordon Esq. Secretary to the Highland Society of Scotland ; A. T. Blackwood Esq. of Oggs Castle ; Mr Dick senior &c. The cloth having been removed and the usual loyal toasts drank the chairman in a neat and appropriate speech proposed the health of Professor Dick to whom the present meeting had assembled to do honour and who at once commanded their esteem as a member of society and their admiration as a man of talent which toast was drank with the greatest enthusiasm. The chairman then proposed his Grace the Duke of Gordon and the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland Patrons of the Edinburgh Veterinary College which was followed by a variety of other appropriate toasts. Many excellent songs were sung and the conviviality of the evening was kept up until a late hour. Royal Infirmary –We understand that the Stewards of the late Fancy Ball for the benefit of the Royal Infirmary have by their judicious arrangements in the management of the ball been enabled to pay over to the trustees of that institution (after deducting all expenses) the sum of t432 7s. 8d. The managers of the Infirmary as well as the public at large are certainly much indebted to the gentlemen who acted as stewards upon that occasion for their valuable extertions particularly at the present time in support of this great and useful institution for the relief of those labouring under the united calamities of indigence and disease.  ID278,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1839,06,05,inform,Daryanthus Excelsa –This most magnificent and gigantic plant is now in full bloom in one of the hothouses at Dunkeld gardens. It is a native of New South Wales and to be met with in this country in very few collections–this being the third plant of the kind that has flowered in Great Britain. It is one of the four plants which were sent from New Holland to the Duchess of Atholl twelve years ago and the only one that has survived the voyage. The seapus or stem is upwards of twelve feet in heigh from the top of which diverge seven stalks each bearing nine large flowers of a deep crimson and pink colour. The formation of the stalks and outer petals of the flower remind one of the Crinum Amabile but much larger. We had no communication as a guide to its culture but kept it at all times and in all season associated with the most hardy green-houseplants.– Dunkeld Gardens 24th May. By the death of Sir James Montgomery the office of Presenter of Signatures in Scotland has become vacant. We understand that this office is no longer to be conducted by deputy. On Thursday the 23d ult. the United Associate Congregation Kendal gave a unanimous call to Mr William Ritchie preacher to be their pastor.  ID311,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1842,03,19,inform,Monument to the late Earl of Dur hum. –The New Zealand Company have voted t105 towards the erection of the monument to the Earl of Durham–the noble earl having been the first governor of this important company.  ID332,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,06,25,entertain,Col. Alexander MacGillivray the celebrated Chief of the Creek Nations and an Ally of the United States died lately in the Creek territories. He passed most of his life in the remote parts of America. By his regulations the Indians have been very much civilized. His death has occasioned universal regret among his people.  ID371,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,12,13,inform,Extracts from the New-York Daily Advertiser. Pittsburgh Sept. 7. SUNDAY last arrived an express in this town from the commissioners who were sent to treat with the Indians: he had left the commissioners on this side of Lake Erie that day eight days. They had been met at Niagara by Indian commissioners and with them had sailed in separate vessels to the mouth of Detroit river 18 miles from Detroit where our commissioners were directed to remain until an asswer should be brought from the great council of Indian nations assembled at the rapids of the Miami and the Lake. On the 2d of August an answer was brought to this effect that the only terms onw hich peace could be made was our ceding the country on the west of the Ohio and Allegheny rivers. The commissioners suggested the impossibilities of doing this as the lands had been sold by the Congress and people had settled on them but that the United States would be willing to give more goods than they had given at any other time. The Indians replied that if the Congress would give one half these goods to the people that had settled the would leave the land and remove the difficulty. Our commissioners replied that the land they must have and would not give it up. The Indians said it was well and there need no more be said. However desired them to remain if they thought proper until they returned to the council and laid this before them. On the 16th of August two Indians came and informed that the final result of their deliberations was the country in question or war. The express is of opinion from the language of individual Indians in private and from other circumstances that the British wholly conduct their council and dictate their demands. By the arrival of some person from Fort Washington on Monday last we are informed that the Indians still contiue hovering about our garrisons and occasionally stealing horses that the army is in high spirits anxiously waiting the event of the treaty and hoping that a campaign will take place as no idea of peace is entertained by any one; that the greatest pains has been taken by the commander in chief in training his men in the act wood fighting and that from their proficiency and the???imity prevailing throughout the whole army success may be expected should a campaign take place. New York Sept. 17. A Mr. Spier was removed from his lodgings in this city on Sunday last to Governors Island where he died this morning. He arrived from Philadelphia last Thursday was seized with Fever on Friday.–The Doctors pronounced it the malignant putrid fever and the event prov ed their opinion to be just. According to a list published of the births and deaths in the several religious societies of Philadelphia it appears that from August 1 1792 to August 1 1793 the Births amounted to 2511 and the Death to 1467. Philadelphia Sept. 21. The stages for New-York returned to this city with all the passengers (mortified and fatigued.) One of the drivers had a very narrow escape with his life being cruelly fired upon at Trenton; the ball passing within a few inches of his head! The ladies &. have been without any refreshment on the road as the panic and terror with which every mind is possessed by the writings and measures above alluded to prevented their obtaining any accommodations on the road– O tell it not in Gath! declare it not in the streets of Askelon ! Ye New Yorkers and ye Baltimorians you have been generous to strangers; but forgot the charitable and fraternal attention due to your own fellow-citizens! Sept. 25. Extract of a letter from a gentleman who lately left his city on his way to the southward. We were stopped about seven miles from Baltimore by armed men who used us with every indignity and hatred truly indicative of malice prepense. These detained us in the stage from five to the afternoon until ten the ensuing morning; during this interval one of these ruffians who appeared to be a German snapped his piece at one of this party who seemed inclined to leave the stage with an apparent design to go among the bushes nears the road; this guard in their tender mercy wre pleased to hand us a piece of dry cheese on the end of a pitch-fork. After this quarantine we were permitted to go to Gray's Garden and there to perform another for the space of two days and nights. New-York Sept. 28. Extract of a letter from Philadelphia to a gentleman in Baltimore dated the 20th instant. You request I would endeavour to give you a parti cular account of the state of the city in general and the rise and progress of the malignant fever now raging here. I believe it will be difficult precisely to determine its origin; but it is generally admitted to have been imported from Cape-Francois in a vessel which came to a wharf betwen Arch and Race-street beause the infection broke out ina house connected with that vessel and it was afterwards traced to that vessel. The disorder overtook several families thereabouts. But most people apprehended it to be the general fall-fever which acted severly on those who had the influenza–To that there was no material danger apprehended until the death of Peter Ashton in Vine-street who after a short illness died about one month past; after which the disorder was clearly discovered to be the putrid or yellow fever and each person became after of his neighbours insomuch that if any became sick they were avoided and many fled from the sick leaving them in adestitute situation perhaps shut up in a house and the neighbours alarmed merchants and housekeepers moved into the country and fear was stamped on every countenance–infirmness possessed the hearts of the people–little business was done except packing up–engaging waggons to move goods into the country and searching for shelter for their families; many families set off without having a particular place to go to. Thus the country became alarmed. Individuals died in the country–but I cannot learn ?hat it spread there. The overseers duty became exceedingly heavy and several of them were taken sick; others abandoned their post and the business bore very hard on the remaining few. Finding deaths increasingly abundantly they procured carpenters to make coarse coffins by the do???. The malady still increasing in Water Front Race and Vine-street threatened desolation in those quarters. The overseers moved by the distresses of the helpless took possession of Bush-Hill mansion (it being empty) and erected a hospital employed some physicians and nurses; sent out some accomadations and provided for interring the dead. The overseers became inadequate to the business by reason fo fear; few in number and the funds exhausted; added to this the extravagant wages of the nurses two and three dollars per day most of the magistrates fled; the house of employment and hospital shut their doors against all indigent and indisposed persons. Thus were the people who had been private patientes on the poor list abandoned and had no sheltering place and those who were slightly indisposed were sent to Bush-Hill and became victims with many others. The inhabitants were requested to meet by public advertisement and a committee of 40 was appointed to take charge of the Bush-Hill hospital and to relieve the distressed in the city and its vicinity they became organized Ianto693 negociated a loan in the bank two of the number voluntarily offered their service to see the business of Bush-Hill properly conducted; bedsteads were procured the house cleaned matrons appointed and nurses under their direction; an apothecary with medicine &c. and four physicians to attend once a day. The remainder of the committee attend at the State House receive information from the committee at Bush - Hill and supply their demands; receive all sheets shirts &c. &c. at the State-House also keep a supply of ready made coffins to furnish as occasion required. Several carts are procured for the various purposes of carrying out the sick whom the doctors pronounce to have the fever of disposing the corpsand for carrying provisions and other necessaries to and from the hospital. THere is also a house fitted up and under the care of a matron to be for the use of those children whose parents have died with the fever; as all their relations and neighbours are shy of them; the governor has directed the State Treasury to be open for their use and they to be accountable to him for their expenditures.–The city seems quite solitary and business at a stand; deaths numerous and no parade at the interment of any; the bells do not ring nor is there any invitations to the funeral of any. I think about 1000 have died since the disorder first made its appearance but it cannot be ascertained with precision; and we think between 15 and 20000 removed from their habitations. The doctors suppose the disorder a little checked by the cool weather; how that is I know now. By a passenger arrived from Albany this morning we learn that in order to prevent the introduction of the Yellow Fever in Albany they have formed Committees and fixed a Gun-Boat at some distance from the city where all vessels are stopt till the Doctors examine the passengers– And that Colonel Hamilton and Lady were arrived but were denied admittance into the city and had taken lodgings at a Mr. M'Gown's at Green-Bush. October 2. Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Philadelphia to the Printers of this PAper dated September 28. The papers must have amply informed you of the melancholy situation of this city for five or six weeks past. Grave digging has been the only business carrying on; and ndeed I may say of late Pit digging where people are interred indiscriminately in three tiers of coffins. From the most accurate observations I can make upon matters I think I speak within bounds when I Say eighteen hundred persons have perished (I do not say all of the yellow fever) since its first appearance on the 3d of August in North Water-street; others think a larger number–but I confess we are a good deal in the dark on the subject at present and it will take some time to have accurate returns made. People have been hitherto so panic struck that little has been attnded to but the means of self-preservation; gloom and melancholy is on every persons countenance; nothing but the yellow fever is talked of; the street are often seen without a passenger; the wharfs are deserted the markets miserable and uncommonly high and nearly one half the citizens departed. The city is truly republican; pomp and distinction have in a great measure disadpeared and bad Plato himself come among us to preach up the practice of true republicansim his lectures could not have had a greater effect upon the minds of men than the present mortality. We make use of no other precaution for avoiding the contagion than not going into infected houses–keeping our own well aired clean and frequently having the walls white-washed. considering the general terro I have more than once felt my pulse to discover whether I was really alive or not; however I now begin to hoep we may escape as cool weather is fast approaching and one-street in general healthy. Of all things this yellow fever is the most insidious– its approaches are generally gradual–a person imagines himself well when he is dying–other loss the use of reason entirely and die in that situations. with those few that recover its effects are long left. It acts like a steeltrap–when once it gets hold of a person it does not easily let him get off. Philadelphia Oct. 7. Died of Sunday the 29th ult. Samuel Powell Esq. Speaker of the Senate of this commonwealth a gentleman of a benevolent disposition an improved mind a sound understanding and an honest heart. Died on Friday evening after a short illness with the present maligant fever at Mrs. Grant's–Mr Chase a yong gentleman of respectable connections of Baltimore. Winchester Sept. 20. Extract of a letter from our correspondent at??? Creek Territory South of the Ohio dated Sept. 4. Times here were but a gloomy aspect. The???le daily harassed by the Indians. On the 27th of August a party consisting of about 300 killed Lieut. Janks Tedford of the United States troops and a Mr. JAckson as they were gathering corn in a field for their horses near Henry's stations–They have lately burnt many houses on the Nine Mile and destroyed a prodigious quantity of wheat rye and corn. WE hope Governor Blount on his return to this territory will be invested with power to desstroy these barbarous tribes. From the same dated Sept. 14. On the 30th of August some Indians killed one young woman and scalped another in Washington county; and on the 5th instant a part of them wounded four persons and scalped one about nine miles from Green Court - House; a house was also attacked by them but they were forced to retreat by the owner thereof and one of his daughters who fired several rounds and wounded some of them. On the 16th another party of the savages killed a woman and child on Nine-Mile. New-York Oct. 16. Monday evening last a number of persons assembled in the fields when they commenced the demolition of Mother Cay's house which in a short time was intirely resed to the ground floor; the furniture beds clothing &c. were all destroyed. another house of ill fame tenanted by Mother Giles under went a similar fate. It is aid that three persons were wounded one dangerously from the firing of small arms by some persons who were placed in the house for its defence.–We lament that our worthy Mayor received some injury in endeavouring to disperse the people.  ID379,Trewman's Exeter Flying Post,Exeter,England,United Kingdom,1810,01,11,inform,CORONER'S INQUEST.–An inquest was held yesterday evening before Anthony Gell Esq. at the Nag's Head in Grange-court Leicester-square on the body of Ann Paris an unfortunate young creature of interesting appearance not more than 17 years of age who it appeared had been reduced by some unknown melancholy circumstance to the most forlorn and destitute situations. It was stated in evidence that she had taken her lodgings only seven weeks and that during that time she had evinced the most wretched state of mind and on Thursday morning urged on by the poignancy of her feelings or derangement of her intellect she swallowed a considerable quantity of laudanum. On the violence of her death-pangs coming on medical air was sent for but too late to be of any assistance and in a short time she expired.–The Coroner's Jury returned a verdict of Lunacy. The history of this poor young creature is at once romantic and interesting. She is the daughter of a Monsieur Paris who was well known in the commencement of the Revolution and in which he suffered. Madame Paris with her infant daughter took refuge in this country; and in the ruin of her fortune became a governess in a noble family in Scotland. After this she had a house in the New-road; and about two years ago died of the rupture of a blood vessel. Her daughter had been placed at an eminent boarding-school near one of the new squares; and on the death of her mother was placed under the guardianship of a Member of Parliament who with the most liberal and benevolent attention to her destitute situation resolved to complete her education; and she had every master of eminence in all the elegant arts. She spoke French and Italian; touched the piano with great execution; sung with taste; and had read beyond her years. About six or eight months ago she was met in the square when walking with the other young ladies by a young man in the dress of a midshipman who followed her to the door and who wrote to her under the name of Jones. A correspondence took place. Her imagination was fired; and she eloped with him under a promise of marriage. His address was found in her box and they were traced by her guardian and separated. Jones declared that she was virtuous and his intentions were honourable and as a proof of it he was ready to marry her with her guardian's consent. In effect they were married and she was completely undone. In about a fortnight or three weeks Jones threw off his disguise and fairly told her his real character– that he was no sailor but lived by his shifts; that he had married her only for the sum her protector had paid him and that she must provide for herself. She was abandoned; and the shock had such an effect on her imagination that she has ever since shewed signs of a disordered intellect. With a heart that shrunk from vice she was flung on the world without a friend or a home; and in this deplorable state she became the victim of necessity. About three weeks ago she saw an officer who is distinguished for his gallantries and who by his address and attentions so won upon her affections that she could neither speak nor think of any other object. This fatal attachment absorbed her whole soul. They entered into engagements to live and die only for one another; and in the frenzy of this passion or under the idea that she could not be his and his alone she took the desperate resolution of dying for him. She had prepared three phials of opium who of which she swallowed and she died with a spirit of heroism; for no persuasion nor force could make her when seized with the nausea of the poison take any antidote to the draughts. She would not suffer the medical men to approach her–and though after stupefaction came on they administered every known medicine they all failed of effect.  ID380,Examiner,London,England,United Kingdom,1810,01,17,inform,On Friday an Inquest was held at the Nag's Head Leicester-fields on the body of Madamoiselle Ann Paris then lying dead at No. 4 St. Martin's-street Leicester-fields.– Sarah Upton deposed that she is housemaid to the place. She had frequently observed that the unfortunate young lady appeared to be rather flighty and tiresome in her manner such as ringing the bell violently giving orders and almost immediately after giving counter-orders; at other times she would ring with equal violence and when any of the servants inquired what she wanted she would tell them she wanted nothing. At one time the deceased gave the witness a shilling to buy her some laudanum. The witness said Good God Miss you surely must be mad to think of such a thing; besides you know it is contrary to law and I can't procure it. She then set down and wept bitterly; she said she could get it in a minute; she had been used to take it for a pain in her bowels.–The witness replied Very well miss you may kill yourself but I shall not give my assistance to the deed. On Wednesday she went out at two and returned at half after six o'clock. She then said that she had given a coachman a 1 l. note at Brompton she had to pay the man only 2s. but she would not wait for her change as she thought it was much better to lose money than time. She went out about a quarter of an hour after the time of her coming home and returned again at eight o'clock having her bonnet all bedizened with artificial flowers. She got a candle went up to her own apartments and returned in about seven minutes time; she refused to take tea with two ladies that were in the parlour at the time; she sat down at first in an extremely pensive manner then in the course of a minute or two with the utmost wildness in her countenance she exclaimed Oh I shall never see him again! I have done the job–I have taken good care that the laudanum I took should do the business. The witness was instantly alarmed knowing that the deceased had ordered her to get some laudanum for her before then. She ran up stairs in the utmost consternation and saw the phials in the lady's chamber. Upon her return she endeavoured to get some explanation for the poor young lady as to what induced her to commit such an act of desperation but in vain–she looked wild and continued raving for some time and then fell into a state of stupefaction. Medical assistance was sent for; three Professional Gentlemen attended but they could afford her no relief. She died before day light on Thursday morning. The witness knew nothing of any particular visitor to the deceased; neither had she the least knowledge of any of her relations or friends.

Coroner for Westminster on the body of Madamoiselle Ann Paris then lying dead at No. 4 St. Martin's-street Leicester-fields. Sarah Upton deposed that she is housemaid to the place; that the deceased had lodged about seven weeks in the house during which time the witness attended more particularly than any other servant about the person of the deceased. She had frequently observed that the unfortunate young lady appeared to be rather flighty and tiresome in her manner such as ringing the bell violently giving orders and almost immediately after giving counter-orders; at other times she would ring with equal violence and when any of the servants inquired what she wanted she would tell them she wanted nothing. She was also extremely incoherent in her discourse rambling from one subject to another with the utmost rapidity and without there being the least connection between each. In answer to a question from one of the Jurymen the witness said that the deceased was by no means in the habit of drinking but that on the day on which the unfortunate affair took place she thought the deceased appeared wild as if she had been drinking. At one time the deceased told the witness that some one had said she was mad; another time she gave the witness a shilling to buy her some laudanum. The witness said Good God Miss you surely must be mad to think of such a thing; besides you know it is contrary to law and I can't procure it. She then set down and wept bitterly; she said she could get it in a minute; she had been used to take it for a pain in her bowels.– The witness replied Very well Miss you may kill yourself but I shall not give my assistance to the deed. At other times the poor young lady would be to all appearances in excellent spirits when all of a sudden she would burst into tears without any thing being said or done at the time to occasion it. She would sometimes fiddle with her clothes like a person who was beside herself; she would collect a few flowers and deck her hair with them and a thousand other little tricks that appeared to to the witness to be the most manifest proofs of a deranged intellect. On Wednesday she went out at two and returned at half after six o'clock. She then said that she had given a coachman a 1l. note at Brompton she had to pay the man only 2s. but she would not wait for her change as she thought it was much better to lose money than time. She went out about a quarter of an hour after the time of her coming home and returned again at eight o'clock having her bonnet all bedizened with artificial flowers. She got a candle went up to her own apartments and returned in about seven minutes time; she refused to take tea with two ladies that were in the parlour at the time; she sat down at first in an extremely pensive manner then in the course of a minute or two with the utmost wildness in her countenance she exclaimed Oh I shall never see him again! I have done the job–I have taken good care that the laudanum I took should do the business. The witness was instantly alarmed knowing that the deceased had ordered her to get some laudanum for her before then. She ran up stairs in the utmost consternation and saw the phials in the lady's chamber. Upon her return she endeavoured to get some explanation for the poor young lady as to what induced her to commit such an act of desperation but in vain–she looked wild and continued raving for some time and then fell into a state of stupefaction. Immediately on the unfortunate occurrence being known medical assistance was sent for; three Professional Gentlemen attended but they could afford her no relief. She died before daylight on Thursday morning. The witness knew nothing of any particular visitor to the deceased; neither had she the least knowledge of any of her relations or friends. Mr. Emanuel Gristock of Wardour-street surgeon stated that between ten and eleven on Wednesday night he saw the deceased; she refused all medicine that was offered her for the purpose of expelling the poison; with some difficulty however the witness forced part of an emetic down her throat; she said she new she had done wrong; and in disjointed sentences and in broken accents raved something about her loving a young man. Upon examining her apartment the witness found one small bottle full of laudanum and two others empty which evidently had contained the same sort of poisonous liquid; their contents must have been between two and three ounces. He left the patient at twelve being under the necessity of attending another at Knights - bridge. Mr. James Wilkes of the Haymarket surgeon saw the deceased at half after two on Thursday morning; she was then in a state of actual torpor the nervous system appeared to be totally deranged and she was incapable of making the least exertion with her body or limbs. She appeared to be past all hopes of recovery from the moment the witness saw her. However having been previously apprised of the situations of the patient the witness had taken a bottle containing an emetic in his pocket. With the utmost difficulty he forced part of it down her throat but it had no effect–the patient continued in the same torpid state until five o'clock in the morning when she expired. Dr. Hooper prescribed some other medicines which we attempted to be administered ut in vain; the patient was totally incapable of swallowing them. A jeweller had known the young lady for a considerable length of time; he had served her with a variety of trinkets in his line of business and was in the constant habit of attending her two or three times a week. He had frequently observed the poor unfortunate young lady act with the utmost inconsistency and wildness; he had repeatedly known her to burst into tears in the midst of apparent merriment; he had known her to order clothes to dress for going out then turn short and saw she would not go out that day; and he had known her once after sitting for some time in the most pensive mode imaginable start up suddenly and exclaim No I will not stand this. She was between 17 and 18 years of age; he understood that she was born in France but she spoke English as well as French. The day before the occurance of the melancholy transaction which was the subject of the prevsent consideration of the Jury she had with frenzy depicted in her countenance exclaimed Well if my wishes are not fulfilled I shall hang or drown myself. The witness had not the least knowledge of what she alluded to neither had he ever heard that she had any relations in London. He was most decidedly of opinion that she was deranged in her intellects. The Jury without a moment's hesitation returned their verdict– Insanity. The history of this poor young creature is at once romantic and interesting. She is the daughter of a Monsieur Paris who was well known in the commencement of the Revolution and in which he suffered.– Madame Paris with her infant daughter took refuge in this country and in the ruin of her fortune became a governess in a noble family in Scotland.
