E. wind succeeded in carrying her off at six a.m. The captain and crew having refused to listen to their invitation to join them in their piratical undertaking with the exception of the mate were permitted to leave the ship in the boat which reached Robin Island in safety about four o'clock the same day. By a letter received to-day we learn that the Admiral Gambier Brash laden with Government stores for Ceylon was totally lost on the morning of the 20th of June last having struck on the reef Roan de Nova in the Mozambique Channel ; crew saved. A letter from Halifax dated the 27th Nonember says – Colonel Bouchette Surveyor - General of Lower Canada with Captain Campbell of the 60th regiment and Mr Bouchette jun. arrived here on the 19th inst. The only information I can yet give you is that the exploring survey has been extended from the source of the St Croix river to the river Restigouche in line about 100 miles ; in this short distance both parties experienced difficulties and sufferings of the severest nature. The Americans employed on the same line with our English Commissioners are represented as men of great ability and acting with that spirit of liberality that infuses confidence on each side rendering their arduous task less severe and gloomy than was to have been expected in thie untrodden wilds of this quarter. Our trade continues dull and money scarce. Government bills are 3 per cent advance but expected to be lower in consequence of the Commissary-General having refused to take the provincial notes. Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard –On Friday night about half-past nine o'clock this place was thrown into the greatest consternation by the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard the beating of drums and the firing of the men of war's guns. It was occasioned by a fire having broken out in the house belonging to the steam engine erected for carrying on the new works situated in the southern part of the dock - yard near the kilns used for burning cement stone. The most serious apprehensions were entertained for the safety of the arsenal ; and what was more distressing to the feelings of the spectators was its coniguity to the workhouse which from the pressure of the times and want of employment is crowded with many unfortunate individuals. Providence however averted the impending danger and about twelve o'clock we had the pleasure of seeing the raging flames subdued with only the loss of the engine-house. No lives it is understood have been lost but one poor man is severely hurt. Captain Walker of the Northumberland and the officers of that ship Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter and Captain Brown and the officers of the Ordinary with the military officers and soldiers of the garrison assembled on the first alarm. The latter were under arms the whole time and were of great service in keeping off the spectators. The inhabitants of the twon were at one time under serious apprehensions as the fire was not far from the Fountain tavern and the residence of Mr Miller in High Street. At the former the landlady of the house had but recently lain in and was removed on the first alarm being given. Sir Robert Barlow from Chatham who superintends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle was here yesterday to investiage into the cause which it is suspected arose from carlessness – The damage however has not been so great as was at first expected and which it might have been but for the prompt and effectual assistance that was given – Sheerness January 11  ID169,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,07,12,inform,Maritime Intelligence The Jane Drummond of Liverpool arrived at Savannah was plundered on the 22d April in [?] 34 10. long. 41. 21. of all her specie 20500 dollars stores provisions &c. by a Spanish ship of 300 tons armed with 14 guns and two stern chasers and full of men. She was supposed to have been out two or three months from Cuba. She had a yellow waist woman head painted black and was coppered to light water mark. Intelligence from Marseilles dated 22d inst. states –' An English Captain who left Oran on the 13th inst. and arrived yesterday in this port has declared that a squadron of five armed ships which he was assured were destined for the North Seas sailed from Algiers at the beginning of the present month. A vessel the Prompt sailed on Tuesday evening from Greenock for Quebec having on board emigrants from Anderston Rutherglen Lesmahogow and Lanark to the number of about 350 persons. The Rev. Mr Easton of Montreal goes out with the Prompt. The Hibernia M'Eachren from the Clyde to Buenos Ayres was totally lost the 15th April near Maldonado. Crew saved. Discovery of a New Island off Cape Horn A new island has been discovered off Cape Horn in inst. 61 deg. long. 55 deg. by the ship William on a voyage from Monte Video for Valparaiso. The same having been dispatched by Captain Sheriff of the Andromache frigate to survey the coast had explored it for 200 miles. The captain went ashore found it covered with snow and uninhabited. Abundance of seals an whales were found in its neighbourhood. He has named the island New Shetland. Accounts from Constantinople dated May 26 annouce that the armaments against Ali Pacha are upon the most formidable scale and are actively pursued.– The latter has obtained hostages of his principal officers as pledges of their fidelity. On the 14th two new ships of the line were launched in the presence of the Sultan and his Grand Dignitaries at the hour fixed by the chief astrologers. The navigation between Bagdad[?] and Bassurah has been free since the defeat of the Arabs by the English. The latter it is stated have facilitated the intercourse between those two places by the establishment of parket-boats.  ID280,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1839,07,24,inform,Collision at Sea. –We are sorry to learn that the fine new ship Palmyra which sailed from Greenock on her first voyage for Sydney New South Wales on Wednesday week having a large number of respectable emigrants on board came in dreadful collision when at sea on Sunday evening with another vessel and had her bulwark driven in and some of the masts dismantled but providentially no lives were lost. She was towed back to Greenock on Wednesday morning and the utmost exertions are making for her re-sailing from Greenock early next week.  ID344,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,05,17,inform,Kingston Feb. 6. By a St. Christopher's paper of the 25th ult. we learn that the small-pox raged lately at >Surinam to such a degree that within the space of two months upwards of 2500 persons had perished by that disorder. A very severe shock of an earthquake was felt between give and six on the evening of last Thursday se'ennight at the settlements near the Blue Mountains. On Wednesday the 3d instant arrived at Lucca the ship Pitt Captain Hunter from Africa with154 Gold-Coast Negroes. On the passage from Africa nine of the seamen mutined whom Captain Hunter has brought confined in irons and they are to be tried at a Court of Admiralty Sessions. Feb. 20. Very strong suspicions are entertained by the Americans that the Indian Chief M' Gilveray and the nations under his immediate controul or in alliance with him are subsidied by the King of Spain. It is a well known fact that they are regularly supplied with cloathing arms and ammunition from the Royal Magazines at St. Augustine and Pensacola and therefore in all probability; the sword not the olive branch will be the most speedy and effectual agent for terminating the disputes. March 6. Tuesday last arrived in the harbour of Port Royal from Cork his Majesty's ship Chichester of 44 guns armed en flute Lieutenant Craven Commander having on board the first battalion of the first or Royal Regiment of of foot commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Dundas. The other Officers are–Captains Duncan Franer Pemberton and Mannoch; Lieutenants Sir W. Jas. Cockburne Bart. Nicholson Puxley Clunes Browne Clarke Drummond and Graham; Adjutant Sir. W. J. Cockburne Bart. Quartermaster Mr. Davidson Surgeon MR. Young; Ma?e Mr. Bolton. The troops in the Chicester amount to 500 men exch??e of 100 women and children. Colonel Hunter is appointed superintendent of the settlement at the Bay of Honduras in the room of Colonel Despard recalled. Col. Hunter came out with the earl of Effingham; it is therefore probable that the disputes which have so long subsisted between Lieutenant Colonel Despard and the inhabitants of the Bay of Honoduras will be brought to a speedy determination. At the sale of the late Peter Heningson's estatea negro blacksmith was sold for the extraordinary sum of two hundred and sixty pounds! At two o'clock on Tuesday morning the 3d regiment quitted the barracks in this town and at Up Park Camp and embarked on board the Chichester for Great Britain; the 14th at the same time taking possession of their quarters. Advice is received from St. Mark's in Hispaniola that on the 1st of this month a number of free people of colour to the amount of 700 and upwards having possessed themselves of several field pieces formed a camp in that districh and exhibited an appearance of hostility highly alarming. A deputation of five gentlemen being sent from the Assembly to demand the reason of so extraordinary a proceeding the insurgents demanded that a remonstrance which they then delivered to the deputies should be presented imimmediately to the general and that an answer thereto should be given without delay. The paper being conveyed as they desired proved to be a sensible and well written detail of the various claims the free people of colour had on what they termed the justice of the whites with whom they demanded an equal participation of all rights and immunities whatsoever–the privilege of representation and of qualifying for all the learned professions–and concluding with the avowal of a determination to proceed to extremities should their demands be treat with neglect. On the perusal of this paper it was judged adviseable to assemble a body of the militia who headed by the General immediately went against the camp. On their arrival the insurgents fired and fled to the mountains; three or four of the whites were killed and one of the ringleaders was taken and instantly beheaded. A proclamation was then issued offering a reward of 50 half joes for the head of any principal offender and in the course of a few days not less than twenty seven were brought in. On Sunday the 7th instant a very great majority of those who had formed the camp finding all their attempts completely frustrated came in and took the oath of allegiance to the nation. One or two of the principals for whom high rewards are offered are not yet taken. From Port Maria we have received the disagreeable account of the loss of the ship Lion Capt. Smith belonging to Liverpool: a violent breeze on the 5th instant drove her from her anchors and she now lies stranded on the beach.  ID345,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,05,24,entertain,NOOTKA SOUND. The circumstances of thetrade and situation of this part of North America being a matter of such general conversation and great public moment we are particularly happy in being enabled to give some further account of the transactions that have happened at Nootka Sounds as well as to point out the advantages that were likely to be extended to other places by the means of this trade. It is necessary to remark that the skin of the sea otter is worn only in the Northern regions of China. Its fur though beautiful and magnificent is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of the Southern Provinces. Pekin is therefore the proper mart for this valuable commodity and in this immense city the consumption is so great that the produce of the voyage meets and immediate sale. The Mandarins of the Court and even the Emperor himself are fond of wearing this costly fur. To a citizen of common rank a sea otter's collar to his vestment is a luxury. The natives of the North West Coast of Ameerica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds that all the blankets cloths hats and stockings that could be procured in China if English manufacture were sold to the Indians with whose Chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed. An act of cruelty committed by an officer of the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to be recorded. The Spaniards discovering that Callicum a Chief second in authority at Nootka Sound was in alliance with the English he was shot through the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife of Callicum with an infant child escaped but not till wounded. Macquilla the Chief first in command retired at the head of the allies of England from Nootka Sound and to avoid the cruelty of the Spaniards they fled to distant parts. Such of the natives as they could seize the Spaniards condemned to work as slaves on their fortifications. At this period it was in the contemplation of the Spaniards to seize the Sandwich Islands with a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. And we further add on authority that amounts nearly to demonstration that on the very lands purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain Mears the Spaniards have already opened valuable mines. Another object of this enterprise wasto supply the markets of Kamschatka and other ports belonging to the Russians with the teas and other produce of China. This promised to be an invaluable channel of commerce as the Chinese have shut their ports against the Russians who On this voyage of discovery and experiment one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo but was unfortunately lost on her return to China. To these curious particulars we add with a patriot joy that the consumption of the glorious staple of England her broad cloths is astonishingly great in Japan and China: British hard ware &c. is also in great request. From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may depend on the utmost attention and civility. This Prince is six feet 4 1/2 inches high of proportionate bulk.  ID351,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,08,17,inform,By private letters and newspapers lately arrived from Philadelphia and New York we have informmation that the Indians are carrying on their depredations on the back settlements of the United States with great vigour; that an enquiry as to the miscarriage of the war had been made by Congress and an army was collected this year; that the Americans had some expectations of getting free of the Indian war by treaties. We have advices of Governor Clinton's being re-elected Governor of New York state by a majority of 180 but the friends of Mr. Tay were objecting to the return as the canvassers had not opened the boxes which contained the returns from three counties Otsego Clinton and Tioga which if opened they say would have given the election to Mr. Tay the county of Otsego alone being 300 majority in favours of Mr. Tay. A dreadful storm happened at New York on the 1st of July which continued with so much violence that several vessels were driven from their moorings and a number of boats upset and many lives lost.  ID398,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,15,inform,By letters received from Norfolk in Virginia dated the 23rd of July we learn that on the 10th of that month the ship Betsey of Greenock Capt. James Young had arrived there in 19 days from Jamaica and brought the following melancholy relation which he received from the crew of the Prudence whom she picked up on the 1st of Juin lat. 22. 40. long. 85. 32. That from the 7th to the 10th of June the weather had been very hazy with little wind so that Capt Addies could not get an observation and a strong current setting to the Southward and Westward drove them farther leeward than they imagined. On the 12th about 3 o'clock in the morning the watch discovered Cape Catuloh but before intelligence could be given to the Captain she struck. For some time she made no water but about seven the water came in so fast that by eleven o'clock A. M. the water was six feet in the hold (the depth of the water in which she lay) the people being sixteen in number took to their long boat and endeavoured to make Cape Antonie; but after four days fruitless labour they were obliged to return to the wreck where they found two Spaniards plundering who informed them that there were only four inhabitants on the island and therefore they could receive no assistance from them; upon which having taken a quantity of beef and biscuits aboard they left the wreck a second time and after having been absent fourteen days were providentially picked up by the ship Betsey and carried to Norfolk in Virginia. The Prudence was from Jamaica bound to London and had upwards of 500 hogsheads of sugar and rum on board.
