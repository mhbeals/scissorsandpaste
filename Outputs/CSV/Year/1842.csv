        ID312,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1842,05,18,inform,There is something curious in the preference which the emigrants from England Scotland and Ireland display for different localities. The proportions emigrating the countries below are as follows:– Emigrants English Per cent. Scottish Per cent. Irish Per Cent. To United States 54 14 1/2 12 – Sydney 17 21 1/2 7 – Canada 8 1/2 25 50 – Port-Philip 8 14 7 As the table expressly bears to be a return of the persons who have emigrated we can scarcely suppose that it includes persons who went out to the countries mentioned on business without any intention of settling. In the report for Canada the number who went to the United States in 1841 is stated to be only 32500 or about two thirds of what stands in the above table. It will be observed that not a single emigrant to India or Ceylon appears in the table; yet surely some persons go with the express view of remaining in these countries. The number of person who were enabled to emigrate in 1841 by means of bounties payable in the colonies was for New South Wales 22752 for Van Diemen's Land 331. It must be remembered that New South Wales includes PortPhilip. There are returns of land sold but not in a very perfect form. In Canada in the year 1839 1840 and 1841 the lands sold were 176518 acres. The average price was 3s. to 3s. 8d. in Lower and 12s. to 13s. in Upper Canada; the lands granted without sale were 194000 acres exclusive of those for Lower Canada in 1841. In Nova Scotia New Brunswick and Cape Breton about 200000 acres have been sold at prices varying from 2s. 3d. to 3s. 8d. The lands granted are inconsiderable. At the Cape 129000 acres have been sold in the three years at prices from 2s. 5d. to 3s. 3d. Lands sold in New South Wales Acres. Average Price. Sydney District–1839 234272 8s 2 1/2d. 1840 105900 18s. 8 1/2d. 1841 15790 20s. 0 1/2d. Port-Philip–1839 38343 36s. 6 1/2d. 1840 83687 51s. 11 3/4d. (Six months)– 53733 20s. 0d. 531930 The sales were chiefly by auction. In Van Diemen's Land the sales in 1839 1840 were about 130000 acres at 10s. or 11s.; in Western Australia (Swan River) in 1839 1840 1841 the sales were 71000 acres from 6s. 1d. to 11s.; in South Australia 55000 acres at 20s. The sales of land are no bad index of the progress of the colonies in capital and cultivation; and according to this criterion it will be seen that those which were advancing most rapidly in the three years were Sydney and Port-Philip. The money received in payment of land in these two colonies in 1839 and 1840 amounted to t307647; and if we understand the report correctly the whole of this sum is applicable to emigration that is to defraying the expense of carrying out emigrants. The 118592 emigrants probably carried with them or expended on their passage twenty pounds each; and thus the money which left the country must have amounted to upwards of two millions. This gigantic emigration one of the things which convey an idea of the immense resources of Britain. The United Kingdom contains only the ninth part of the population of Europe; and we believe it may be safely said that all the other eight parts do not send out half the number of emigrants annually which are sent by the British Isles alone. ,undefined
        ID313,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1842,02,05,entertain,A ustralian Trust Company Incorporated by Royal Charter No. 48 Moorgate Street London. Capital t100000 in 10000 shares of t100 each with power to increase the capital to t2000000. Directors. Chairman– John Abel Smith Esq. M.P. Levi Ames Esq. . Robert How Esq. Henry Bainbridge . Esq. John Innes Esq. Thomas Byron jun. Esq. . Francis Mowatt Esq. Benjamin Green Esq. . Charles John Pearse Esq. William Hart Esq. . Hastings Elwin Esq. Langford Hovell Hodge . now in Australia Esq. Auditors. Right Hon. The Lord . Sir Edward Parry R.N. Mayor. . Nassau William Senior Abel Lewis Gower Esq. . Esq. Bankers–Messrs Smith Payne & Smiths. Solicitors–Messrs James Charles & H. Freshfield. Colonial Board in Sydney. Chairman– Hastings Elwin Esq. who was Deputy Chairman of the Court of Directors. Alexander Macleay Esq. . Richard Jones Esq. Thomas Barker Esq. . John Lamb Esq. To be joined by Thomas Icely Esq. who was a Director here and who is on his way to Sydney. Solicitor–James Norton Esq. The Company was established and incorporated (and is now in full operation) to carry out in Australia a principle which has been acted on with great success elsewhere namely that of taking up money in this country at a moderate rate of interest on the credit of a large invested capital and laying it out on undoubted freehold security at a higher rate. The Company is now prepared to grant transferable notes under the Corporation seal to persons desirous of advancing Money to the Company on loan. The notes will be for t100 each or any larger sum desired by the lender and will be made payable at any period which may be agreed upon not being shorter than two years. The notes will bear interest at the rate of five per cent per annum payable half-yearly (on the 15th January and 15th July) on the production of the half-yearly vouchers which will be annexed to each note: these vouchers or coupons will render it unnecessary for the holder of a note to present the note itself until the principal becomes due. The form of note has been preferred to that of bond as admitting of transfer without expense or trouble whilst it affords equal security to the holder. The Colonial Board has been established in Sydney and the operation of the Company are at present confined to New South Wales. Security being the first object of the Company all the arrangements have been framed with the view to attain that end. The Loans are made at a fixed interest of 10 per cent although the current rate is much higher. The land mortgaged (exclusive of collateral security) must not be of less value than double the amount of the loan. The non-payment of interest on the day it becomes due subjects the mortgager to 2 1/2 per cent additional interest for the period in arrear; and all parties in default for ten days are to be proceeded against the Solicitor of the Company without further instructions and without distinction or exception of any person whatever. The Colonial Board only draws on the Company as loans are agreed on; their bills must be advertised for public competition and the purchasers pay the amount in exchange for the Bill to the Bank of Australasia (the Capital of which is t120000) to the credit of the Company to be drawn out by checks of the Colonial Board in favour of the borrowers as the mortgages are completed. The high character of the members of the Colonial Board affords the fullest assurance that these arrangements will be strictly adhered to in spirit as well as in form; no difficulty has been experienced in investing the full monthly amount sanctioned by the instructions of the Court of Directors: indeed the Chairman of the Colonial Board states that he does not entertain the smallest doubt of a safe investment of all the funds which may be placed at the disposal of the Colonial Board. The high rate of interest in Australia has attracted much private capital from this country to be invested in mortgages. These investments have been made through the agency of individuals or mercantile firms and therefore subject to contingencies from which the Company is exempt. To those who may desire to make such investments it must be obvois that the stock of the Company presents a much superior security and the prospect of a greatly increased return inasmuch as the Company derives a large profit by lending at 10 per cent in Australia the money borrowed here at half that rate. It is equally clear that those who merely seek temporary employment for their money without becoming shareholders cannot have a better security than the Promissory Notes of the Company for the due payment of which the whole capital of the Company as well as the mortgages on which the money is laid out stand pledged. Every shareholder is required to execute in a Deed of Covenant by which he becomes bound to pay to the full amount of his shares and the Charter supplies Creditors with the utmost facility in enforcing demands against the Company. When it is considered that the funds of the Company here are kept in Government Securities and no money lent in Australia except on the best mortgages on land with collateral security in addition it may be fairly asserted that in many respects the Promissory Notes are entitled to a decided preference over mortgages in this country which generally bear one per cent. less interest than that paid by the Company. The Charter provides that the sums borrowed shall not exceed four times the amount of capital paid up. That the whole capital of the Company and all the mortgages on which their money is lent in Australia shall constitute a security to the lenders of money to the Company. That the mortgages are to be on land with the power of taking collateral security on stock &c. That every mortgage shall be registered–the register to contain such particulars as the Governor of the colony may deem necessary. That a copy of the register of the mortgages shall be kept at the office of the Company in London for the information of the share-holders and lenders. That an annual report be made to the Lords of the Treasury of all sums borrowed by the Company and of the appropriation of them. John Innes Managing Director. No. 48 Moorgate Street. London 1st January 1842 ,undefined
