*Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Bermuda to**his friend in Norfolk, Virginia, dated April*  2."By Captain Gilbert, the bearer of this you will learn our distress for want of provi - sions: There has not been in the whole island one bushel of corn for sale for 16 days past. Capt. George, from Baltimore, brought in ???days ago two bushels of corn, which sold immeddiately at 6s. 8d. per bushel; he also brought in 360 barrels of flour, common and superfine, which sold at eight and nine dollars per barrel. No vessel has arrived here with provisions since Capt. George; and no vessel belonging to the island is expected to relieve us. A great number of poor people have been for ten days past obliged to live on the greens of the field. Governor Hamilton, by advice of his counsel, has opened the port of Bermuda to all foreign vessels whatever, for thirty days, to be computed from the 30th day of March, laden with bread, corn; or flour. He also allows, for three months, the importation of salted provisions from any foreign port whatever, in vessels belonging to these islands. IT is said, what if any foreign vessel should come here after the time permited by proclamation, they will be allowed to dispose of their cargo, if they can prove they set out with an intent to come here. If any vessels be ready to sail from Norfolk, with provisions, advise them to call at Bermuda."
