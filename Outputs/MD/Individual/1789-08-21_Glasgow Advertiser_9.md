*Curious Anecdote*.–A few days ago a stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly, Treasurer of the East India Company, and desired to speak to him in private ; when the were retired, the stranger said to Mr. Sibbly, " I am lately returned from India, I have smuggled goods to the amount of about 120l. What duty have I to pay upon them?" Mr. Sibbly smiled, and told him, "That he could receive no such money without the Chairman's permission." Pray then (said the stranger) speak to him of it as soon as possible. I am resolved to pay whatever the duty is. The Company pays for the exclusive privilege of bringing India goods to Europe; the man that deprives them of any part of the advantages they hope to reap from it, cannot, in my opinion, look upon himself as a strictly honest man." Since the stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly, the Chairman had not had time to give him an answer ; the stranger notwithstanding, gave him a letter, including a Bank note of 30l. The sum Mr. Sibbly told him he should pay, if he paid any thing.
