A letter from the Bay of Honduras, dated May 26, says, "The Spaniards, who pay an annual visit to this settlement, to prevent encroachments, are destroying all the cultivated spots on shore, alleging that the settlers are prohibited by the convention from cultivation of any kind. This will prove a temporary misfortune to the woodcutters, by depriving them of the principal means of subsisting their negroes, and might be productive of mischief, were it not that the British Superintendant, Colonel Despar, with the assistance of the Calypso sloop of war, keeps the woodcutters in order. This may rise the price of mahogany at home, and certainly will raise provisions here.
