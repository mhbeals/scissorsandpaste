*Extract of a letter form Philadelphia, dated 25th  May, 1789.*"I have travelled through several of the States and see no appearance of the poverty which you hear so much boast of in Britain–every where I meet rather with extravagance. Indeed they procure too easily to be frugal in their out-givings. All the manufactured goods imported from Europe are from Britain, and they cannot have goods equal in quality and price from any other place."I think I never say so many children as are in this country, every town, village, and farm-house, are full of them.–The people of this country increase like rabbits: It is supposed they double their numbers every fifteen years; but I should think they do it in a shorter period.–What a grand prospect for the sale of British goods, for when so many hundreds of millions of acres of land lye idle to be granted or purchased at a small price, the people of this country never will manufacture ; At present wages are high, and 1000 acres of land in the back settlements may be purchased for as many pence?."
