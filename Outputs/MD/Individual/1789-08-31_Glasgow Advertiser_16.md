Lord M'Donald, to his great honour, adopted a most liberal plan of establishing, at his own expence, not only one, but a number of free-villages, on his extensive domains. By this plan, proposed to his Lordship by Mr. Fraser, the settlers are to have perpetual feus of the lands, subject to a very moderate quit rent. His Lordship will by this means prevent the threatened emigrations to America, and deserve the highest praises of his country.
