"From some late communications it is evident, that as much sugar may be made on the new lands in the States of New-York and Pennsylvania as will supply the whole United States, and perhaps in a little time furnish an article of exportation. The profits of the manufactory of sugar, when made by private families, will be greater than when made by large works. A boiler, which will cost only 16s. will be the whole expence that will be necessary to carry on this business, and the sugar may be made at a season of the year when no work can be done upon a farm. The price of it, when sent to Philadelphia, will be twice as high as the same quantity of wheat.  The sugar trees may be made to yield their juice without being injured, and when they decay, fresh ones may easily be cultivated in the soil upon which they now grow. When we consider the value of sugar, its general and wholesome use in diet, and above all, that it has hitherto been obtained at the price of the lives and liberty of our African brethren, we cannot help congratulating our fellow citizens upon the prospect of manufactories of that article being established among us, whereby immense sums of money will be saved to our country, and, what is more, our country freed from the guilt of encouraging the detestable traffic in human creatures."Several hundred sugar-kettles, we hear, are now making in New Jersey, for the use of the the New England settlers of the Susquehannahand Delaware."
