*New York, Aug*. 20.The weather last week, in this city, and suburbs, continued to be extremely hot until Sunday midnight, after a thunder squall. The change which then took place was very sudden and unhealthy.Upwards of twenty persons fell unhappy [?]ic tions to the heat last week; and it is said, that as many of them died by over labouring as by drinking cold water, Raw rum has been found exceedingly pernicious in this extreme heat; –man who was seen intoxicated but a few momments before, suddenly fell on one of those days –and the cry was–" Poor fellow! he has certainly drank too much cold water!" Cold water has however been instantaneously fatal in se - veral instances. [ *To be concluded in our next*.]
