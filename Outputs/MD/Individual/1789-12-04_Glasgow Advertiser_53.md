*Extract of a letter from Carricou,Grenada,Sept*. 5."By a vessel which arrived here yesterday from Martinique, we are informed, that there is an insurrection of the slaves in that island ; at one periot it was supposed that there was not less than ten thousand of them assembled in one body, and there are now above four thousand encamped in the neighbourhood of St. Pierre's. The business, it is said, has originated from an idea they have got, that all the slaves in the British colonies are to be liberated, and they are resolved to be upon the same footing."
