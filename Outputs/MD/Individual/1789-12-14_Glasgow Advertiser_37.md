 The West India merchants, who were in the utmost anxiety for the arrival of the packet from the West Indies, have been most agreebly relieed from their apprehensions. The account of the insurrections in Martinique, which we received through France, and which has been since confirmed in the National Assembly, naturally alarmed them for the British islands. We are happy to inform our readers, that the packet brings no intelligence whatever of tumult of insurrections. We have not heard even that the letters bring any account of the conspiracy in Martinique ; a circumstance which can only be accounted for by the little communication which exists between the islands at this season of the year."
