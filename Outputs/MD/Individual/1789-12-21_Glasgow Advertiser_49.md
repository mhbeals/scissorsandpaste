Letters from Jamaica say, that by vessels arrived there from Hispaniola, there are advices that the French inhabitants of that island feel, with unabating energy, the glorious cause in which their patriotic countrymen in Old France are embarked. Men of every class and description wear the national cockade of blue and white. Their accounts from France, similar in date and substance to ours, have filled them with the most lively hopes, and animated them with a spirit of resistance to the measures of their Government, as forcible as it was unexpected by those entrusted with the executive power. At Port au Prince both the Governor and Intendant have rendered themselves completely odious, by vain attempts to counteract an impulse that is irresistible. The effigy of Mons. Marbois, the latter, has been hung and burnt; the people loudly insist that both shall immediately quit the colony, and their departure is hourly expected. The press, hitherto under the severest restraint, triumphs in its freedom; and their weekly publications give an account of the proceedings of the States General without the smallest reserve.
