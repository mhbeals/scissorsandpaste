Advice from Charlestown, South Carolina, says that the Indians in Washington county commit the most horrid depredations and cruelties. They have set fire to several houses; and a woman, who had a sick husband, telling them from a window, of her calamity, they shot her dead on the spot, and then set fire to the spot. The sick man was consequently burnt.A Colonel Harling has greatly exerted and distinguished himself in opposing the Indians on a part of the American frontiers. This gentleman, with two hundred men, even went into the very heart of an Indian settlement, and defeated the savages. He then penetrated the country, destroying all before him, and returned without the loss of a man. Every possible acknowledgement was made of his services and bravery, and a liberal subscription made for his gallant little army.
