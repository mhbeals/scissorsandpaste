The American States having now gained their independence, have no cause of quarrel let with this country; but matters are very different between them and Spain. It is well known, that the Indians on the back settlements have been regularly supplied with arms and ammunition from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies, to enable them to distress the Americans, and prove at least a hindrance to their growing prosperity.The free navigation of the Mississippi has been denied them?and the Spaniards, now in possession of the Floridas, have been continually quarrelling with them about their boundaries.It may therefore be considered as almost certain, that the American states will take an active part against Spain. This will be a great acquisition to Britain in every point of view; for though American cannot furnish money, she can furnish men and provisions; and afree intercourse with her ports must prove of infinite advantage for the security of our West-India Islands. Their privateers, too, will be able to take their runs so speedily, that the Spanish trade must be very materially injured thereby.
