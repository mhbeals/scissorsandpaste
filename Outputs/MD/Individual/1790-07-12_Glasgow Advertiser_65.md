 By the last letters from India, we understand they were going on in the plodding way, with nothing new or important.–The markets are overstocked with British goods, so as to enable our countrymen to supply themselves with most articles at a cheaper rate than if they were at home ; the credit of the revenue rather upon the increase ; Lord Cornwallis is as strict as ever, who is expected to remain another year among them, to the no small regret of those who left England for the sake of Oriental wealth.Our *female adventurers*  have also found it a bad market ; *British beauty*  never fails of finding its admirers ; but the late restriction in the East have rendered *wives*  forbidden fruit, of which neither *civil*  nor *military*  dare to think of tasting.
