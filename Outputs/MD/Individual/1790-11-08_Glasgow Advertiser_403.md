Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Edinburgh to his friend here, Nov. 6." There have been an amazing number of recruiting parties here these 8 days by gone, and I dare say they have got among them at least 200 recruits this week. Only in two or three particular instances have large sums been given–the bounty is generally from 5 to 6 guineas." This place is at present full of people, many of whom may be said to have no more than what keeps soul and body together–I heartily wish they would also take away our loose women–they were never so numerous, nor so troublesome. If it was not for the recruiting service, and the prospect of a Bridewell, which it is hoped our Magistates will shortly set seriously about, we would have but dismal prospects before us the ensuing winter.–I am informed, government propose sending 2000 of our bad women–they would never be missed out of this place."
