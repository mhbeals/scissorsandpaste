A *Transfer of *Conjugal Love.On Monday last was married at Stockport, an inhabitant of Macclesfield, to a female on whom he had fixed his *affections*. It is to be observed, that he did not toil through the tedious forms of courtship, but at once got a wife, as others sometimes get good places, by *purchase* –and, as we are informed, the lady was valued at eight guineas and thirty yards of Irish cloth, at 2s. 6d. per yard–which property he deposited in exchange for *earthly treasure.* –Whether a wife may be cheap or dear at that price, time will shew. Her former husband, having seen military service, was not to be discomposed at *trifles*, and his *philosophy *probably being strengthened on the occasion, he attended the happy pair to church, and saw the marriage ceremony ; after which they spent the evening at the bridegroom's house, where all was gaity. The first husband parted with an helpmate had *borne his sorrows twelve years ;*  and the second husband received a *partner of his joys, *after having buried a former one *just a week.*
