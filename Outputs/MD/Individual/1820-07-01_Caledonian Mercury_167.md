The New York Daily Advertiser says–"The line of battle ship New York, now finishing at our navy yard, at the Wallabut, is perhaps the most superior vessel ever built. Her tonnage is near 3000[?]: she measures 203 feet keel, and is by 15 feet the largest man of war ever laid down in this country. She will no doubt be rated a 74, but will be equal to a 100 gun-ship, and will carry 120 guns."
