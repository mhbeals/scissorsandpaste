It was imported to this country two years ago by a man who had served his time in Van Dieman's Land. Its[?] favourite soil seems to be high land or muir country, and is so rapid in growth, that it appears not only to choke but to extirpate[?] every weed with which it comes in contact. It is said to be the best plant in the world both for feeding cattle, and for producing mik from cows, of the best and richest quality. Were the propiertors and tenants of the Highland country to follow the enterprising conduct of Mr Blair, we would soon see their hills covering with a truly useful plant, instead of the useless heath, with at present, even at best, only adorns them.  ID278 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1839 	06 	05 	inform 	Daryanthus Excelsa –This most magnificent and gigantic plant is now in full bloom in one of the hothouses at Dunkeld gardens. It is a native of New South Wales, and to be met with in this country in very few collections–this being the third plant of the kind that has flowered in Great Britain. It is one of the four plants which were sent from New Holland to the Duchess of Atholl, twelve years ago, and the only one that has survived the voyage. The seapus or stem is upwards of twelve feet in heigh, from the top of which diverge seven stalks, each bearing nine large flowers of a deep crimson and pink colour. The formation of the stalks and outer petals of the flower, remind one of the Crinum Amabile, but much larger. We had no communication as a guide to its culture, but kept it at all times, and in all season, associated with the most hardy green-houseplants.– Dunkeld Gardens, 24th May. By the death of Sir James Montgomery, the office of Presenter of Signatures in Scotland has become vacant.
