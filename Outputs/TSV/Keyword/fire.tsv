Just as we arrived there was a famine, and it was really a shocking sight to behold; you could not move out of your house but the corpses lay in your way, and the wild dogs and jackalls were eating them at noon-day. The Hindoos never bury their dead, but burn them to ashes, if they can afford it; if not, throw them into the river. I have lately seen a man brought to the river side, and laid down at lowwater mark before he was dead ; and when the the tide flowed, it carried him off. If a man, woman, or child, dies at night, the corpse is eaten by the morning. This I have been an eye witness of ; for as I always rode out on horseback every morning, I had an opportunity of seeing more than those that did not. In the course of six months I became so much used to it, that I took no notice of it. I was there when a dreadful conflagration took place, and burnt upwards of seven miles without intermission, and many souls perished. Now consider, first, an inundation; second, a famine; and third, a conflagration. How much the place must be distressed, I leave you to think. I left Decca the 1st of December last, and arrived at Calcutta, after a passage through the Sunderburns (in 17 days), hearty and well, thank God.  ID123 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1818 	01 	19 	inform 	Extract of a letter from the agent to at the Cape of Good Hope, dated 15th Nov. 1817: – The following most daring instance of piracy was committed in our harbour on the 11th inst. viz.– The Elizabeth, White, lying at anchor off Robin Island, with about 120 tons of oil on board, was boarded at about one a. m. by a party of armed deserters from his Majesty's 10th regiment, and convicts, about 12 in number, i. e. five soldiers and seven convicts, who, after securing the hatches, &c. obtained possession of the ship, and in the same instant cut the cables, loosed the sails, and favoured by a strong S. E. wind, succeeded in carrying her off, at six a.m. The captain and crew having refused to listen to their invitation to join them in their piratical undertaking, with the exception of the mate, were permitted to leave the ship in the boat, which reached Robin Island in safety about four o'clock the same day. By a letter received to-day we learn that the Admiral Gambier, Brash, laden with Government stores for Ceylon, was totally lost on the morning of the 20th of June last, having struck on the reef Roan de Nova, in the Mozambique Channel ; crew saved. A letter from Halifax, dated the 27th Nonember, says – Colonel Bouchette, Surveyor - General of Lower Canada, with Captain Campbell, of the 60th regiment, and Mr Bouchette, jun. arrived here on the 19th inst. The only information I can yet give you is, that the exploring survey has been extended from the source of the St Croix river to the river Restigouche, in line about 100 miles ; in this short distance both parties experienced difficulties and sufferings of the severest nature. The Americans employed on the same line with our English Commissioners are represented as men of great ability, and acting with that spirit of liberality that infuses confidence on each side, rendering their arduous task less severe and gloomy than was to have been expected in thie untrodden wilds of this quarter. Our trade continues dull, and money scarce. Government bills are 3 per cent advance, but expected to be lower, in consequence of the Commissary-General having refused to take the provincial notes. Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard –On Friday night, about half-past nine o'clock, this place was thrown into the greatest consternation, by the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard, the beating of drums, and the firing of the men of war's guns. It was occasioned by a fire having broken out in the house belonging to the steam engine erected for carrying on the new works situated in the southern part of the dock - yard, near the kilns used for burning cement stone. The most serious apprehensions were entertained for the safety of the arsenal ; and what was more distressing to the feelings of the spectators, was its coniguity to the workhouse, which, from the pressure of the times and want of employment, is crowded with many unfortunate individuals. Providence, however, averted the impending danger, and about twelve o'clock we had the pleasure of seeing the raging flames subdued, with only the loss of the engine-house. No lives, it is understood, have been lost, but one poor man is severely hurt. Captain Walker of the Northumberland, and the officers of that ship, Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter, and Captain Brown and the officers of the Ordinary, with the military officers and soldiers of the garrison, assembled on the first alarm. The latter were under arms the whole time, and were of great service in keeping off the spectators. The inhabitants of the twon were at one time under serious apprehensions, as the fire was not far from the Fountain tavern, and the residence of Mr Miller, in High Street. At the former, the landlady of the house had but recently lain in, and was removed on the first alarm being given. Sir Robert Barlow, from Chatham, who superintends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle, was here yesterday to investiage into the cause, which it is suspected arose from carlessness – The damage, however, has not been so great as was at first expected, and which it might have been but for the prompt and effectual assistance that was given – Sheerness, January 11  ID244 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1834 	09 	24 	inform 	The St Nicholas, Morgan, which has arrived off Aberdeen from Bathurst, New South Wales, reports that timber was very scarce ; that the woods between that town and Miramichi were on fire ; that 250 tons of cut timber had been burnt, and the people in the woods had been obliged to abandon their camps and fly to save their lives. The thermometer at Bathurst was from 85 to 90.  ID308 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1841 	12 	29 	inform 	Theatre Royal. –The Pantomine, we observe, is postponed till Friday. Meanwhile, the theatre is crowded nightly, the public being admitted at second price from the commencement of the performances. Music Hall. –We stated, about two month ago, that, in connection with other improvements in the Assembly Rooms, a plan was under consideration for erecting a Music Hall. We are now happy to announce, that at a meeting of the proprietors of the Rooms last week, full pwers were given to the Directors to take the requisite steps for carrying the design into execution. The desire so long felt by the cultivators of music here, will soon be realisd, by the erection of a splendid hall, constructed with a due regard to the accommodation both of professional men and the public, and with a minute attention to the most recent improvements, by which full effect is secured to musical performances when conducted on a grand scale. By what may be called a propitious coincidence, Mr Bishop, the new Professor of Music, arrived in Edinburgh on the very day when this resolution was come to. Martin's Paintings. –The exhibition of these celebrated paintings in this city has already, we believe, attracted many visitors. They are truly wonderful creations, and possess a power and grandeur of which the engravings, so familiar to the public, convey but a faint conception. In contemplating the Deluge, the spectator is so [?] [?] [?] the scene, that he is apt to overlook the details; but these will be found on inspection to be among the most interesting features of the picture. The groups of perishing beings are exquisitely wrought, while everything is made to contribute to the terrific grandeur of the catastrophe. The other two pictures–Pandemonium and the Rivers of Bliss, are smaller in size, but equally indicative of the high poetic genius of the artist. Nothing could be more striking than the contrast these pictures present to each other–the one fearful beyond expression, the other exhibiting a heavenly serenity and loveliness on which the eye rests with delight. There are several other valuable paintings in this collection, amongst which is The Offering Up of Isaac, a Rembrandt in fine preservation. Gordon's British Diorama. –This beautiful exhibition opened on Saturday last, and has, we understand, been crowded with visitors ever since. It will be seen by Mr Gordon's advertisement in to-day's paper, that the view of the Tower of London during the recent conflagration (to which we alluded in our last) has now arrived, and is being exhibited along with the other views. Broughton-place Congregation.–We understand that the call given by BroughtonPlace Congregation to the Rev. Mr Croon, Sanquhar, to be colleague to the Rev. Dr. Brown, has not been accepted, owing to the strong claims which the affectionate people among whom he presently labours have to continuance of his services, and his unfitness, as he alleges, for a charge so laborious; a result which, we learn, has caused among the members of Broughton-Place extreme and general regret. Cooke's Equestrian Amphitheatre, Leith. –Mr Cooke has generously handed over to the Provost, for the benefit of the Destitute Sick Society, the handsome sum of t15; being the free proceeds of Friday evening's entertainment, which took place under the patronage of the Provost and Magistrates. Captain Ross' Discoveries. –Extracts from Captain Ross' despatches have been published in a Parliamentary paper. From the map which accompanies the paper, we gain a more distinct idea of his track than the previous article copied from the Athenean[?] afforded. South Victoria Land, which he discovered, extends in latitude from 70 1/2 south to 79, how much farther is unknown; and in longitude its eastern coast lies between 163 and 171. Its position is directly south from New Zealand, and at the distance of 1500 geographical miles. The length of the part seen was fully 500 miles. It was girt with a border of ice many miles in breadth, which rendered it inaccessible. The passage southward was closed at latitude 78 by a barrier of ice 150 feet high, which was traced for 300 miles east from Victoria Land. Icebergs were encountered in numbers after they passed parallel of 63, and pack ice at 66. The land rose in lofy peaks from 9000 to 12,000 feet in height, perfectly covered with eternal snow; the glaciers descended from near the mountain summits, project many miles into the ocean, and presented a perpendicular face of lofty cliffs. They could not reach the mainland, but landed on an island, which they found to consist of volcanic rocks. On 28th January, in latitude 77 1/2, longitude 169 E., they discovered a magnificent volcano, emitting smoke and flame in a splendid profusion, and named it Mount Erebus. An extinct one near it was named after the other vessel, Mount Terror. At the distance of less than half a mile from the ice cliffs which barred their progress southward, they had sound ings with 318 fathoms. These cliffs, no doubt, reached the bottom, and, including the 150 feet above water, must have had an elevation fo 2000 feet of thereabout. The observations on the dip and declination induced them to place the South Magnetic Pole in latitude 76, and east longitude 153; and they considered its position as well ascertained as if they had reached it, though their nearest approach to it was a point 160 miles from it, on the east coast of Victoria Land. The pole is probably within that region, though this cannot be positively affirmed, as its western boundary is unknown. The highest latitude they reached 78. 4. They were therefore only 12 degrees from the pole and about 4 degrees nearer to it than Captain Weddel[?], the most successful of their predecessors. The Non-intrusion Disclosures. –In the Advertiser of yesterday there is a letter from J. M. Hog, Esq. of Newliston, and another from the Rev. Dr Simpson of Kirknewton, both expressing their extreme surprise at the letter of Mr Hamilton (which appeared in our last), and strongly disclaiming all connexion with it on the part of the General Assembly's Committee. Sabbath Observance–The Sweetie Case. –We understand that the Government of Prussia, thinking that the mode of keeping the Sabbath in that country was in some respects too lax, recently sent over a person to this country, to learn whether our practise in Britain would not furnish hints for improvement. Unluckily, the very first specimens of our piety which met him were the sweetie case, and that of the poor man Key who was excommunicated for burying his child on Sunday. These will of course figure in the very front of the officer's report as the natural fruits of our system, and we may guess what their effect will be in reconciling the Germans to a stricter observance of Sunday! We can, moreover, inform Butters' prosecutors, that the fame of their exploits has already travelled, by the aid of the Teutonic newspapers, to the uttermost parts of Germany, to the infinite amusement of the Swabian farmers, the Saxon miners, and the shepherds of the Riesengeberge. Key's case is no doubt destined to enjoy equal celebrity. Airdrie–Anti-Corn-Law Conference. – On Monday last, the members of the United Secession Church, Airdrie, favourable to a repeal of the Corn and Provision Laws, met, in compliance with the request of the Committee taking the active management of the Conference to be held in Edinburgh on the second week in January next on that subject, when they unanimously appointed their pastor, the Rev. Matthew M'Gavin, A.M., Mr John Craig Waddell, proprietor, and Mr James Forrester, merchant in Airdrie, to represent their sentiments at that meeting, which is looked forward to with great interest by the liberal portion of the inhabitants of the burgh. The Rev. Mr Taylor, with Messrs Adam Nimmo, contractor, and John Young, bookseller, will represent the Independent congregation; and Mr Thomas Muir, pastor of the Baptist church, will represent that body on that occasion. Kirkcudbright–Address to the Dean of Faculty, –We learn that at a meeting, held on the 17th current, of the Clerks and Procurators of the Steward and COmmissary Courts, an address was voted to Alexander Wood, Esq. on his appointment to the office of Dean of Faculty, and his retirement from that of Steward of Kirkcudbright. Distress in Paisley. –We understand that the Bookbinders of Edinburgh purpose to give a Grand Musical Melange in a few days, the proceeds of which are to be handed over to the committee for the distressed weavers in Paisley. Musselburgh. –Mr Wilson, Treasurer to the Honest Town, has, by the hands of the district committeesm collected from the contributors to the Prince of Wales fund, nearly t100; and the committees have already distributed 130 tons of coals to the necessitous families in the neighbourhood. Presbytery of Dalkeith–Case of Mr Monroe. –This Presbytery met on Tuesday the 21st current. At a former meeting an agent appeared for Mr Monroe, presentee to Fala, and laid on the table of Presbytery a presentation in his favour to the parish of Fala. It having been objected that the presentation, and some other papers relative thereton, bore, that Mr Monroe was presented merely to the parish of Fala, and not to the united parishes of Fala and Soutra, the agent made his appearance again at the meeting, which was held on Tuesday, with a supplementary presentation, and also a letter acceptance from Mr Monroe. The agent, when asked, admitted that he had not with him a Presbyterial certificate; and he stated, that he would not ask the Presbytery to sustain the presentation with relative papers at that meeting. But he intimated, that he intended to appear at the next meeting, which is appointed to be held on the 22d of February, and he expected to be able to show that the Presbytery should then sustain the presentation and relative documents. Splendid Meteor. –On Tuesday evening, about eight o'clock, a meteor of unusal size and splendour was witnessed in this quarter. The evening was very clear, the sky being without a cloud, and the moon shining brightly. Suddenly, a dazzling blaze of light burst from the sky, illuminating Benlomond and the distant hills, the Curse around Craigforth, and, indeed, the earth and air on every side as far as the eye could reach, with all the brilliancy of noon-day. The phenomenon appeared like a ball of fire, of an oblong shape, and apparently almost twice the size of the moon, having at the time somewhat of the same silvery appearance as that luminary, but flaming with a brilliancy so intense as almost to dazzle the eyes. A tail of fire somewhat resembling that of a rocket, but composed of the most beautifully varied colours, streamed behind it for a short distance, adding much to its spendour, and giving the whole an appearance at once singularly magnificent and sublime. Before it disappeared, it assumed a red glowing appearance, and then burst for an instant enveloping the earth and sky in a blaze as bright and dazzling as the most vivid lightning. It appeared to pass from the south to the north, inclining towards the earth. To the eye it seemed to burst and disappeared above Gargunnock. Another meteor of the same kind, but much less in size, brilliancy, and splendour, was observed falling in a quartr rather farther to the south, a few minutes previously. It is a coincidence worthy of notice, that a meteor, of the same nature with that first described in the above, was seen at the same hour in Glasgow.– Stirly Journal. Glasgow. –The collection made on Sabbath afternoon last, by the Rev. Mr Macfarlane's congregation, Nicholson Street, Glasgow, amounted to t46, 7s. 6d. This sum is the more praiseworthy when it is considered that this congregation has within a few months subscribed among themselves nearly t1000 for the erection of their beautiful place of worship to be called Erskine Church, of which they are erelong to take possession. The Unemployed in Paisley.–The number of unemployed in Paisley has last week decreased by 43. In Kilbarchan and Barrhead they were still on the increase. The following is the official report of yesterday for Paisley and Barrhead :– Paisley. Males, 1865 Dependants, 4662 –6527 Females, 1680 Dependants, 3360 –5040 Total, 11,567 Barrhead. December 17, 287 ... 23, 346 Increase, 59 – Paisley Advertiser. The Paisley Manufacturing Committee. –This Committee continue to carry on their operations with energy and zeal. The amount of the fund now exceeds t8000, and is still on the increase. They have given out about 700 webs already, and are as busy as possible preparing more. Unable to get a sufficiency of webs warped in Paisley, they have sent for assistance in this respect both to Glasgow and Johnstone. A good deal of work has this week been given to warpers, winders and heddle-casters. They have taken much more spacious premises in Gilmour Street, in order that they may the more easily supply both town and country weavers. It is desirable that the implement fund should be somewhat enlarged, as the other funds of the Committee are not trenched on for that purpose – Ibid. Ducal Generosity.–After the late county meeting at Hamilton, at which addresses were voted to the Queen and Prince Albert, his Grace the Duke of Hamilton and several of those who had attended the meeting visited the jail. One respectable looking female attracted his Grace's attention; and on inquiry he was told that she was the widow of a respectable wood merchant, now deceased, and had been confined for upwards of a year, at the instance of a law agent in Edinburgh, for costs incurred in a suit in the Court of Session. His Grace immediately caused the truth of the poor woman's story to be investigated, and on being satisfied of the facts he caused the debt to be paid by his factor, and procured the woman's liberation, who has thus through his Grace's generosity been restored to liberty and to the superintendence of her young family.– Reformers' Gazette. Presentation. –A number of the members of the United Secession Church, Airdrie, met in their vestry on the evening of Wednesday the 22d inst. when Councillor Brown, in name of the congregation, presented the Rev. M. M'Gavin, A.M., their pastor, with a handsome pulpit gown and cassock, as a mark of their respect and esteem; after which a number of the influential members of the congregation entertained him to supper supper in Mr Witherspoon's King's Arms Inn– Mr Daniel Gray, collector, Coltness Railway, in the chair, and Dr Clarkson, croupier–when the evening was spent in the most friendly, happy, and intellectual manner. A Rescue.–Last week, while the Duke of Hamilton was riding along the wood leading from Hamilton to Bothwell, he heard the screams of a female, and on looking towards the place whence the cries came, he perceived a stout Irishman belabouring a woman in a most unmerciful style. No sooner did he observe this, than he rode up to the scene of cruelty, dismounted from his horse, knocked the savage down, rescued the woman, and sent her home rejoicing, with more money in her pocket than it may have been her lot to possess for a long time. When we recollect that his Grace was born so long ago as October 1767, and so is in his 75th year, we cannot sufficiently admire his gallantry, humanity, and intrepidity– Glasgow Chronicle. Town Council. –The usual meeting of Council did not take place yesterday in consequence of the Christmas holidays. House of Industry. –We understand that Miss Grace Bailie had left a legacy to the Edinburgh House of Industry of ten pounds sterling. Old Church.–The Lords of her Majesty's Treasury have officially intimated to the parties interested their intention to adhere to the original arrangement made with the Town Council, for altering the Assembly Aisle, and rendering it fit to be permanently used as a place of worship for the accomodation of one of the city congregations. Prince of Wales Fund. –In the table of sums subscribed in the different Wards of Police, published in our paper of Saturday last, that indicated for the 26th Ward was t120, 12s. 9d. Mr Lindores, the General Commissioner, requests us to state, that the sum subscribed in his Ward was t275, 12s. 9d., and that the difference between the two sums is the amount of the very handsome subscriptions by the Banks in St Andrew Square, and which were drawn by the Treasurer. Presentation of Plate. –On Friday afternoon, about fifty citizens entertained Mr William Donaldson, of the Albion Cloth Company, to an elegant dinner and dessert, in the Turf Hotel, Princes Street, for the purpose of presenting him with a testimonial of their esteem, subscribed for by the members of the Celtic Lodge, and other private friends. Mr William Wright, hat manufacturer, was in the chair, supported on the right and left by the guest of the evening, Mr Pritchard of the Theatre-Royal, and other gentlemen. Mr Dick of the Albion officiated as croupier. After the usual loyal and preliminary toasts had been given, the chairman called for a bona fide bumper for the toast of the evening, and, after passing a handomse eulogium on those various qualities of their guest which had endeared him to all his friends, neighbours, and acquaintances, far and wide, presented to Mr Donaldson, in the name of the subscribers, a very elegant and massive silver tea set, of the value of t50. Mr Donaldon's health was then proposed and drunk with warm and friendly enthusiasm. The presentee replied to the compliment in modest and appropriate terms. The company spent an exceedingly happy and convivial night; the chairman and croupier taking care that there should be no flagging in the jovialty. The toasts were suitable to the occasion. Mr Mackenzie's instrumental band played appropriate airs to the various toasts and sentiments; and vocal music, from amateurs, was never wanting; the guest himself being a host in that department. The following inscription is neatly engraved on the various pieces of playe :–To Mr William Donaldson, R.W.M. of the Lodge Celtic of Edinburgh and Leith, from a number of Masonic and other Friends.–24th Dec. 1841. Theft and Recovery of a Pony. –At a late hour on Sunday night a gentleman residing in the southern part of the town dismounted from his pony at his own gate, and proceeding inwards, leaving the animal to follow, as he was wont to do, to the stable. On looking about, he observed a young man, whom he supposed to be his son, take the reins and mount the pony. Shortly afterwards the son came into the house, and the question of Where is the pony? soon convinced the parties that it was stolen. They immediately proceeded in search, and while the gentleman was giving information at the Police-Office, his son discovered the pony with a rider on the North Bridge. He immediately seized the reins and made a clutch at the thief; but the latter very adroitly threw himself off at the opposite side, ran down the Fleshmarket stairs, and escaped. Providential Recovery. –One day last week, a fine little child, about five years of age, belonging to one of the villagers at Ratho, having dandered[?] away with another little play-fellow, like himself, to a little distance from the house, fell into a deep well. His companion was found standing weeping at the edge. The apparently dead body of the little one being got out, was taken home, and all hopes of its recovery given up, when Dr Pringle, and excellent young gentleman, who is presently assistant of Dr Craig at Ratho, made his appearance, and, by applying himself with indefatiguable perseverance, succeeded in recalling the apparently extinguished spark. The next the little romp was as lively as ever. Mungo Park. –A public meeting was held in the town hall of Selkirk, on Monday the 26th current, the Chief Magistrate in the chair; when various resolutions were adopted with the view of erecting a monument or other permanent mark of respect for the memory of this celebrated traveller. Thimble-Riggers. –A band of thimble-riggers from Edinburgh have for several weeks past been infesting the roads in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. They are six in number and one of them, an old man of rather respectable appearance, is generally in advance of the party, and having got into conversation with a passenger on the road, and the others running up, and desiring the old man to try his luck; he does so, and winning a trifle, he easily persuades the person with whom he has been ingratiating himself to try also, and he is soon robbed of his whole spare cash. Information having, on Wednesday last, been given to the Procurator-Fiscal at Pollokshaws, and the gang were on the new Kilmarnock Road, he immediately despatched two rural police officers in pursuit of them. On the officers coming up to the gang, they separated and ran off, but the officers captured two of them (the old man and another), who were safely lodged in Pollokshaws Jail; and having been brought before two of the Justices, and several person having sworn to being defrauded by them of their money, they were sentenced tothirty days' imprisonment in Paisley House of Correction, with hard labour, as rogues and vagabonds; and an active look-out is made by the police for the remainder of the gang. Stoppage of Payments by the Town of Paisley. –Partly on account of the great depression of trade, and partly on account of a run raised by the circulation of malicious and false statements regarding the affairs of the community of Paisley, theTown Council, at a meeting on Wednesday evening, ordered the Chamberlain to susspend receipt or payment of deposits, in the meantime, but to proceed with all possible despatch in realizing the outstanding debts due to the community for the regular payment of the interest on the money borrowed, and other current engagements of the burgh. It is pretty generally known that a small portion of the would-be-political leaders of the town who have not the influence to get themselves placed in municipal authority, have for a good number of years endeavoured to embarass the party in power, by attacking the credit of the community. The unfavourabout state of trade and the leniency of the Council in not enforcing during the last year the exactions on the owners of property, for entries, &c. falling due, caused a deficiency of nearly t300 in the usual amount of revenue. This simple circumstance was taken advantage of, though nothing was lost thereby, and statements prejudicial to the town's credit were placed in the hands of every credito that could be found by the individuals referred to, and thus uncalled for alarm raised. In addition to this, the adherents of the same party in the Council during the last five days gave currency to another statement which they knew to be quite untrue, about the late Provost having commenced to secure himself by drawing a thousand pounds, when the fact was he had not drawn out a penny. From the position to which which the affiars the town are now driven a full and public exposure of these matters will soon be submitted to the creditors. The Council have been negotiating for such a loan of money as will pay off those who are dissatisfied, which in the ordinary state of the money market they would long since have obtained, though at present that is difficult. As regards risk to the creditors, from the best informed quarters we are assured there is none. More than one-third of the whole debts of the town are due to the Bank and the members of Council, or their immediate friends, and fully a half of the debt against the river is due to the same parties. This we should conceive the strongest proof that could be adduced of the confidence of those who should best know the state of the town's affairs.– Glasgow Chronicle. Disgraceful Trick.–At a late wake in the country, a short way from Crieff, a waggish fellow tied a cord secretly to the neck of the corpse and while a number of young men and women present were going on merrily with some sport the wag pulled the cord, when corpse started up in the bed, making the clothes to fly off; the whole party rushed to the door, crying for mercy upon them, and knocking each other over in the hurry, when at length some people came to their assistance, who afterwards discovered the cause of their terror.– Perth Courier. The Church Question. –Long ago, Dr Chalmers let out the secret of the clerical movement, by declaring that very little of Non-intrustion would satisfy him and his friends, provided the independent power of the Church were secured. Now, this liberum arbitrium does nothing at all for Non-intrusion; but it does a great deal for Church Independence. It confers no privilege on the laity; but it adds immeasurably to the power of the clergy. It is, in fact, the very worst part of the claims that have been advanced by the Church; and its effects would simply be to sacrifice the lay Non-intrusionists on the one hand, and clerical Moderates on the other. It means literally uncontrolled power to the Church The General Steam Navigation Company's ship Monarch, Captain Fraser, arrived at Granton from London on Monday evening at half-past nine o'clock. Election of a Minister for Old Monk- land. –The election of a minster took place at Old Monkland Church, on Thursday the 23d inst., and the right of patronage being vested in the Heritors and Kirk-Session, the election might be considered a popular one. About 150 voters attended the meeting, and a decided wish having been expressed by, it is understood, the whole of the heritors that no candidate known to be connected with the Non-intrusion party in the Church should be chosen, the meeting, acting upon this principle, unanimously agreed to elect the Rev. Mr Johnston, Greenock, as minister of the parish. Considering the number of voters, the unanimity that prevailed among the electors, it is believed, is without precedent and stongly marks the sentiments and feelings of a large and very populous parish on the present proceedings of the dominant party in th Church. Mr Johnston was proposed by General Pye Douglass of Rosehall, seconded by Mr M'Caul of Daldowie, and unanimously elected.– Reformers' Gazette. Destructive Fire. –About three o'clock on the morning of the 25th curt., an alarm of fire was given at Balmangan Mill, in the parish of Rerwick. The premises are occupied by Mr Kissock, and despite the great exertions of himself, servants and neighbours, the work of destruction proceeded with a degree of rapidity that rendered it impossible to save a single article. The flames in their fury having charred the rafters, the roof fell in with a loud crash; and, before long, the entire mill, with the exception of the side walls, became an unbroken mass of ruins. The building contained a considerable quantity of grain and oatmeal, the property of the tacksman, all of which was unforunately destroyed. As the premises were found quite safe a very few hours previously, suspicion of incendiarism have naturally arisen, but no clue thus far has been found attaching guilt to a single individual. The fire, if wilful, implies the blackest malice, and it is sad to think that any one could have been so wicked as to destroy what thousands are in want of, and would gladly toil for, if they only knew how–daily bread– Dumfries Courier. Hamilton. –Some influential persons in Hamilton and the neighbourhood have subscribed to build an Episcopal chapel in that town. We have been informed that all the requisite arrangements have been made for carrying the views of the subscribers into effect. This is one effect of the conduct of the rebellious majority of the General Assembly. Many of thsoe now friendly to the scheme, never dreamed of espousing Episcopacy, till they have been driven in disgust from the Church of their fathers, by the conduct of their ministers; men who exist in their offices by law, and yet set that very law at defiance, in virtue of which they hold offices, and draw their temporalities, as they cantingly term their good things, which alone induce some of them, at least, to remain members of the venerable Establishment. Who would have believed, some years ago, that Black Prelacy was about to be established within sight of Bothwell Brigg!  ID349 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	07 	25 	entertain 	Norfolk, April 11. This day arrived the ship Albion, John Simmons, master, in 47 days from Rotterdam; on the 8th lying to in a heavy gale of wind, the Albion shipped a sea, which carried away all her boats and every loose article from the deck; there were three men of the watch, one of whom is washed overboard and perished– his name is John M'Naught, and belonged to Greenock. Extract of a letter from a gentleman at the falls of the Ohio, to his relation inWinchester, Virginia. dated April 13, 1791. I wrote to you from Fort Pitt, which place we left the 3d. inst. in company with two other boats, and proceeded to Limestone, without meeting or apprehending danger–at that place we were informed of several disasters which had befallen boats going down the river, and one to a boat going up to a French station, loaded with bacon, butter, &c. The particulars relative to the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked by about 60 or 70 Indians, and the flankets that were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. –Immediately after firing, they gave the Indian whoop, and rushing on the flankets, scalped them every one (about 22)– they then fired at the boat, but did no damage, as it required some time to make their way into the river. After the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity, they continued on the river watching for other boats. In the course of about six days, five or six boats happened to come down the river–the savages attacked the foremost of them, in which were two young ladies, of the name Macdonald, a young gentleman, and some others, passengers, and took it. Elevated with this easy capture, they imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in with–In a little time a second boat hove in fight, which they attacked with great fury–they were in three canoes, each canoe containing about twenty–they moved towards the boat, as it came down, and commenced firing; after discharging their guns, they retreated, loading and came on a second time, fired and repeated nine different times; as often as they come on, there was a brisk firing kept up from the boat, which contained nine fighting men;– during the conflict two were killed, and five wounded; two only remained to protect the boat, and prevent the Indians from boarding it, which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the ???, they threw billets of wood at them, and one of them took up an ax, as a weapon of defence, should they persist in boarding, which the Indians perceiving, and, as is supposed, their ammunition being expended, they retreated, without accomplishing their object. These inhuman monsters, previous to their attacking the last mentioned boat, placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes, in which situation they were both killed. A few days after this transaction, they fired at another boat, and killed one young man. In short, every boat tat has gone down the river lately, has been fired at, except our's. We saw no Indians; the places where the above depredation happened we passed in the night. Boston, May 4. It is supposed that the adventures of the town of Boston, lost 25,000 dollars in the late lottery; besides 'wear and tear' of conscience. Salem, May 31. His excellency our worthy overnor perceiving, with his usual discernment, that Lotteries have a tendency to withdraw the people's attention from industry, the only certain source of wealth and prosperity; and also that they operate as a??? ??? ???, ??? ??? and embarrassed being??? the ??? a venturers; suggests, in??? ??? the Legislature, the propriety of discontinuing this mode of raising money. The states of Connecticut and New Hampshire have passed laws, prohibiting the sale of lottery tickets of other states, in their states. Bennington, May 30. A gentleman from the northward informs, that the part at the British post lately holden in this state, has recently been recalled. Baltimore, May 27. Colonel Jacob Webb, and Captain Miller, formerly of Stamford, in Concecticut, Mr. John Carmel, of Philadelphia, merchant, and several other gentlemen, with a negro boy, were drowned, on the 9th of March last, in St. Mary's river (Georgia) occasioned by the oversetting of a boat, in a sudden flaw of wind. Boston, May 25. On Friday last, the venerable Mr. John Simonds, of Salem, entered the one hundredth year of his age. He is the only male person who has arrived at that great age from the first settlement of the town by the English, in 1629, to the present day. New York, June 9. General Washington, on his tour to the Southern Sates, landed at Charlestown, South Carolina, in a barge decorated for the purpose, with colours and pendants, and rowed by twelve American Captains and a Cockswain, all dressed in blue silk jackets, black silk breeches, white stockings, and blue roses to their shoes. They had likewife hold laced hats; with silk bandeaus, with the motto, Long live the President. An immense number of people assembled near the Quay, and on board the vessels in the river, which, as well as works, saluted him with several discharges of artillery. The day was afterwards devoted to conviviality–The lodge of St. John addressed his Excellency as follows:– Right Worshipful Sir, We the Master, Officers and Members of St. John's Lodge, No. 2 of Newbern, beg leave to hail you welcome with three times three ! We approach you not with the language works have proved you to be the true and faithful Brother, the skilful and expert Craftsmen, the just and upright Man. But the powers of eloquence are too feeble to express with sufficient energy, the cordial warmth with which our bosoms glow towards you–We therefore most frevently wish–more ardently and devoutly pray, that the Providence of the Most High, may strengthen, establish and protect you in your walk through life–and when you are called off from your terrestrial labours, by command of our divine grand master, and your operations sealed with the mark of his approbation, may your soul be everlastingly refreshed with the streams of living water which flow from the right hand of God. And when the Supreme Architect of all world's shall collect his most precious jewels, as ornaments of the Celestial Jerusalem–may you eternally shine among those of the brightest lustre. To which the President returned the following answer:– Gentlemen, I receive the cordial welcome which you are pleased to give me, with sincere gratitude. My best ambition having aimed at the unbiassed approbation of my fellow citizens, it is peculiarly pleasing to find my conduct so affectionately approved,, by a fraternity whose association is founded on justice and benevolence. In reciprocating the kind wishes contained in your address, be persuaded, that I offer a sincere prayer for your present and future happiness. George-Town. April 30. Yesterday morning, about one or two o'clock, the ship Termagant, belonging to the house of Messrs. Claggen, lying in the stream opposite this town, was discovered on fire. The inhabitants of the town and the seamen in the harbour speedily collected, but on account of a quantity of powder that was on board, the efforts that otherwise would have been exerted to extinguish the flames were withholden. The first soon communicated itself to the powder; and the explosion was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of the ship were flying in every direction, and it and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting, store and dwelling houses, on the water side, were prevented from sharing a similar fate with the ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse, the property of Francis and Charles Loundes, situated at some distance from the water, wherein upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stored, was several times, in different places, on fire, ut happily extinguished without sustaining much damage. The loss, occasioned by this alarming element, must be great indeed, as the ship was large and nearly new; besides, there were goods to a considerable amount, and a pretty large sum of money on board of her: all of which (excepting a part of the money, which has since been found) was destroyed. We are informed that this accident proceeded from the steward's falling to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cabbin, which by some means or other, set fire to the sails that were stowed there. It had got far advanced before it was discovered. Providentially no lives were lost. Pittsburgh, May 21. A letter received in this town, on Sunday last, from Lieut. Jeffers, at Fort Franklin, mentions, that an Indian had arrived there, who brought him intelligence that 300 warriors of the Chippawa and other nations had set out for war and that they were determined to strike on the Allegheny or Ohio, near Petersburgh; that 1000 men were preparing, but their destination was not known.  ID370 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1792 	09 	17 	inform 	EXTRACTS FROM LATE NEWSPAPERS. New York, July 5. This city and its vicinity were exceedingly alarmed, last Sabbath, about four o'clock, M. P. by a tremendous westerly tornado, which continued about 20 minutes, twisting off limbs of trees, unroofing houses, and tumbling down chimneys in various parts of the city. Unused to such unruly gusts, the citizens, particularly the fair, were thrown into a momentary d???ation. Terrible was the havoc on the water–in vain did the Sabbath breakers cry for mercy–in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, were they hurried to the bottom, and melancholy was the scene. It is said that 29 persons lost their lives in this neighbourhood, but we have not been able to ascertain who they were for certainty. Report says, that a Mr. Wade, his wife and two of their children, his brother, and a young man, were all, except the last mentioned, drowned from one boat near Yellow Hook, a few miles from the city. It is also said, a sloop overset with 16 persons, all but one of whom were drowned. We learn that the??? extended to Philadelphia, that ship was driven from her moorings there and sunk, and that the road from thence to this city, shrewn violent tokens of its visitation. July 14. The society for promoting the manufacture of maple sugar, met at Albany, July 3, have granted 75 dollars, bounty, to Thaddeus Scribner, of Herkermer county, for having produced 600 lb. of grained maple sugar, of superior quality– of 50 dollars to Comfort Cook, of Otsego, for producing sugar of equal quality, but a less quantity –and of 25 dollars to J. Harris, and R. Huntley, of Saratoga county, for the third rate quantity. The society resolved, to exhibit samples from each of these parcels to the legislature at their text session, in order to induce them to give larger bounties, for the further encouragement of this important manufacture. Aug. 4. On Saturday last, arrived in this city, directly from Scotland.–Nesbit, Esq. a gentleman who comes warmly recommended by the celebrated Dr. Robinson, and several other literary characters of eminence in that country, as a master of the science of canaling, from several years experience both in Holland and in Scotland. The President of the Northern Inland L.?. Company, attended by Mr. Nesbit, and a commitee of Directors, left this city, this morning on a tour, to explore the rive from Troy upwards, for the purpose of prosecuting the canals with spirit the remaining part of the season, and making preparations for its more active prosecution in the ensuing year. Philadelphia, July 12. Accounts from South Carolina and Georgia, with regard to their prospects of the ensuing crops, are very unfavourable, no rains of any consequence having fallen in the more eastern disctricts of these states since the beginning of April; at which time the low country was, in a manner inundaed. The Indigo plantations, when the last vessels sailed, were almost despaired of, for the next crop, and the rice swamps promised not much better. July 18. We are sorry to learn from New York, that spirit of party, respecting a late election of Governor of the State, has arisen to such a height as to have occasioned several duels a week. On Thursday morning last, Colonel W??? and Mr. Wilcocks, both of New York, had a meeting, and exchanged pistol shot, but their friends in??? prevented any bad consequences.–Colonel Willet is friendly to Governor Clinton's election, which Mr. Wilcock opposes. We hear from Maryland that a number of gentlmen of the state are about establishing a society in Port-To??? for the dissemination of useful political knowledge, the study of the constitution of their country, and the keeping up among the people if possible, a knowledge of their rights as free citizens of the greatest, and perhaps the only, true republic in the universe. August 6. On Thursday morning, was witnessed a very melancholy event at Mr. Henry Kizer's power mill, in lower Merion township, Montgomery country, between the hours of 9 and 10. There was a large quantity of powder in the mill, which by accident took fire and blew up with a great explosion, which was heard at Schuylkill ferry, and was there supposed to be an earthquake. Mr Kizer, and three others who were in the mill, were blown to pieces; and a Mr. Henry Fraily, a copartner of Mr. Kizer, was so wounded that his life is dispared of. A young woman who happened to be near the mill at the time it blew up, had both her legs broken, and was otherwise very much injured, by one of the rafters which was carried from the building in the violence of the explosion. Petersburgh, July10. We learn from North Carolina, that a fire broke out in the town of Washington, on Wednesday the 27th ult. which burn nearly half the town.–The loss in houses, goods, &c. is said to be very considerable. ???sburgh, July 21. Extract of a letter from Captain Paul, of the State Levies, dated Middle Block house, of the frontiers of Washington country, July 16, 1792. The Indians on Tuesday last killed two men and one woman, and stole seven horses between the states of Crays Creek and Col. Shepherd's in Ohio county, Virginia.–Lieut. Gray and fourteen of my men followed them over the Ohio, as far as the head of the Soufish, but the Indians being on horseback they returned without coming up with them. On Saturday last, at Dilly's station opposite the mouth of Grave creek, the Indians came into one of the houses and killed four and wounded one; the number of Indians was suppos ed to be twenty. It is thought they will strike this quarter. To-morrow morning I intend to start with a party to try and fall in with them. Martinsburgh, July 24. We are informed, that one day last week, a Mr. Barret, living near the South Branch, accidentally shot his wife;–he was fixing a flint to his gun, and incautiously dragging the trigger, not knowing the gun was loaded, discharged the whole contents into her body, and she died in a few moments after–the unfortunate woman had a young child at her breast, but it providentially received no injury. Alexander M'Gillivray advertises for a tutor, willing to instruct Indian children in the rudiments of the English language; and the first principles ofarithmetic.
