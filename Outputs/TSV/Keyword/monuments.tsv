It is stated, we believe upon good authority, that he accounts for this course of proceeding, by referring to the great probability of the Lords throwing out the Irish Municipal Bill. Burn's Monument. –We understand that there is now an early prospect of the completion of this monument, which has too long remained in an unfinished state, to the surprise of strangers, and the discredit to our Modern Athens. The sum already in the Treasurer's hands, aided by the profits of the handsome musical work lately issued by Mr M'Leod, which he has generously devoted to that purpose, is now nearly sufficient to meet the calculations of the expense requird for the railing in and decoration of the ground around the monument. We expect, therefore, that the work will forthwith be commenced, and if a few pounds are still wanted, we have no doubt there are hundreds in Edinburgh who would willingly guarantee the Treasurer against any loss by the immediate completion of the undertaking. Annuity Tax. –We understand that deputations from several places in the country, are expected to attend the public meeting which is to be held on Tuesday evening, for the purpose of petitioning Parliament for the abolition of the Annuity Tax, in order to testify their abhorrence of that system of politico Christianity which requires distraint and imprisonment for its support. We observe that Mr Gillon, of Wallhouse, M.P. is to take the chair. The meeting we doubt not, will be most numerously attended. Law of Scotland. –The prizes given by Professor Bell, for the greatest proficiency in the examinations, were yesterday awarded to Mr William Neish, 25, India Street, in the senior, and to William Spence, 31, Broughton Place, in the junior class. The following gentlemen also distinguished themselves in the competition : Mr John Fraser, James Gilchrist, James Mason, James Scott, in the senior class; James Oliver, David Gale, John R. Banks, James Charles Murray, Wm. M'Naughton, in the junior. Kilwinning, March 30.–The United Associate Presbytery of Kilmarnock met at Kilwinning on Tuesday, the 22d March, and ordained Mr A. Macgregor to the pastoral charge of the congregation in that place. The Rev. D. Henderson, of Dalry, preached and presided. The Rev. Mr Cairns, of Stewarton, ordained, and the Rev D. Ronald, of Saltcoats, gave the charge to the minister and congregation. On the Sabbath following, the Rev. Mr Tait, of Barrhead, introduced Mr Macgregor to his congregation ; and there is every prospect that the hitherto long disappointed congregation of Kilwinning will now prosper under the pastoral care of their much esteemed and highly talented young minister. Presentation of Plate. –Mr A. S. Walker, late of the Commercial Bank of Scotland, at present manager of the branch of the Commercial Bank of England, at Uttoxeter, in Staffordshire, was lately presented with an elegant tea service by the proprietors of that establishment, bearing the following inscription :– Presented to Mr Archibald S. Walker, by the Uttoxeter Proprietors of the Commercial Bank of England, as a small acknowledgement of his faithful and valuable services–March, 1836. This is another proof of the estimation in which many of the young men are held who have been trained to the banking system in this country. From a Return, just published, we find that the emigration to Canada has been comparatively small last year. The whole number of emigrants landed at Quebec and Montreal in 1835, was 12,527 : in 1831 and 1832 four times, and in 1834 two times as many were sent out. Of the 12,527, there were 5597 adult males, 3866 females, and 3064 children under 14 years. Of the whole number, 1043 were sent out by parochial aid. The numbers from the three kingdoms were– England, 3067 Ireland, 7,108 Scotland, 2,127 From Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, &c. 225 Settled in Lower Canada, 2,297 Upper Canada, 9,800 Died at Grosse Isle and Quebec, 13 Returned to the United Kingdom, 117 Removed to the United States, 300 –12,527 But besides those who went to Canada, 16,749 landed at New York, raising the whole number of emigrants to 29,376. There were no less than three vessels wrecked last year on their way to Quebec– the William Ewing from Londonderry with 300 passengers, all saved–the barque James from Newfoundland, all saved–and the Nathaniel Graham from Cork, with 48 persons on board, passengers and crew, of whom 41 were lost. From another part of the Report, we find that 2764 female emigrants were sent out to Australia last year, under the superintendence of the Emigration Committee. Of these 2105 had a free passage. The arrangements seem to have been ood ; for the mortality was small, and few complaints were made. The females were all of decent character, and due care was taken on their arrival to get them disposed of as servants, in situations where their morals would not be exposed to unnecessary risk. Ulster Railway. –Length 36 miles, from Belfast to Armagh ; capital t600,000, in 12,000 shares, of which t393,000 are subscribed. The number of passengers expected is 450,000; the expected income is t93,000, of which t67,800 is from passengers ; the estimated expense of the work is t539,000. The steepest gradient is 1 in 200. There are 3 tunnels of 310, 320, and 570 yards in length. East Lothian Railway. –We call attention with great pleasure to the Prospectus of a railway from Dunbar to Edinburgh, by Haddington and Tranent, which appears in our first page. No one can have travelled over the ground without observing how admirably it is fitted for this species of communication, by its remarkable uniformity of surface. We should have doubted whether such a work would pay, had it terminated at Edinburgh ; but as a part of an unbroken line reaching across the most fertile and populous parts of Scotland, from the German ocean to the Atlantic, its chances of success are vastly increased. Dundee and Arbroath Railway. –The Committee's report on this railway has reached us, but we must confine ourselves to an abstract. The length is 16 miles 5 furlongs and 90 yards ; the capital t100,000, divided into 4000 shares, which is all subscribed, but authority is taken to raise t40,000 more by loan ; sum paid up t5000 ; subscribed by shareholders locally interested t88,900, by others t7150 : there are three subscribers for t2000 and upwards : the expected income from passengers is t16,912, goods t14,654, from both t31,566. There are no tunnels, no inclined planes, and the steepest gradient being only 1 in 1000, scarcely differs from a dead level. It does not cross any highway or turnpike on a level. The estimated expenses is t99,844. Statute Labour Acts. –It appears from the votes of the House of Commons, that a Select Committee has been appointed to investigate the Scottish Statute Labour Acts, and to consider what amendments may be made thereon. It may be stated, that by the present act for this county, proprietors of land, and several other descriptions of people are totally exempted from any burden, on account of the coaches, chaises, gigs, or saddle horses they may keep, though it is quite plain good roads are of as much advantage to them as to the occupiers of land, upon whom almost the sole burden is thrown. In many parishes a considerable addition would be made to the road funds, were no such exemptions allowed. At present the management is vested in heritors, rated at one hundred pounds Scots and upwards, though it is stated with confidence, that were the occupiers of land included, beneficial consequences would follow.– East- Lothian Correspondent. Leith Mechanics' Friendly Assurance Society. – The fifth annual meeting of this Institution was held on Tuesday last–John Hutton, Esq., one of the Honorary Members, President of the Society, in the chair. A very satisfactory report for the last year was read, and thanks were voted to the different Office bearers. It appears that this society was established under the countenance of the Magistrates and Ministers, and various influential individuals in Leith, and is well deserving of encouragement, as affording the benefits of mutual insurance to the working classes, the lowest rates consistent with perfect security. The funds, we understand, are in a prosperous state. Hay and Straw. –In consequence of it having been alleged last Wednesday, that higher prices were got for straw than those quoted, we have made due inquiry, and find there are no grounds for such an allegation. We have been further assured, that in reporting the prices of hay and straw for these two years past, the clerk of the corn market has never shown a desire to favour the farm servants at the expense of their employers, or to favour either party at the expense of the public. The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have been pleased to grant by their warrant, dated the 6th of April 1836, a distinguishing flag to be worn by the respective vessels belonging to the Eastern Regatta Club of Scotland, viz. a blue cornet flag, with a white St Andrew's cross on the upper quarter on a red field. Heriot's Hospital. –At the meeting of the Governors of George Heriot's Hospital, on Thursday the 7th instant, the estimate of Messrs Trotter for alterations and repairs on the chapel, amounting to t935, was accepted, and it will gratify the friends of economy to learn, that this is t65 under the sum voted by a majority of the Governors for that purpose some time ago. Thereafter a unanimous vote of thanks was passed to Councillor Gillespie Graham, for gratuitously furnishing a plan of the intended improvements on the chapel, which was described by Councillor Grant and others, as highly creditable to the skill and good taste of that distinguished architect. The Governors then proceeded to consider the list of applications for admission of boys, preparatory to the usual half-yearly election. There were 16 vacancies and 37 applicants, who may be thus classed :– Those who have never received benefit from George Heriot's Hospital, or any other institution, 12 Those who have received benefit for one child, 13 Do. for two children, 6 Do. for three children, 5 Do. for five children, 1 37 In considering cases the present practise of the Governors is to give preference, first to children of widows (being poor), then to those who have never received benefit, afterwards those who have had only one child in, and so on. These were but three applications for widow's children, and one for an orphan, out of the above number, and it is therefore probable, considering the large population of Edinburgh, that it is not sufficiently known, that George Heriot, in his will, expressly points out the fatherless and poor, being children of burgesses and freemen, as the objects of his charity–hence, if there be not a sufficient numbers of really necessitous cases, the Governors, in filling up the vacancies, may elect some that do not appear to have strong claims, simply from those that have such claims not coming forward in sufficient numbers. Political Economy. –On Thursday last the course of lectures on Political Economy, delivered by Dr Thomas Murray, in Elder Street Chapel, was brought to a conclusion ; on which occasion the thanks of the meeting were, on the motion of one of the members of committe, voted by acclamation to the lecturer for his valuable services. After thanks had been returned by Dr Murray, Mr A. G. Hunter, merchant, was called to the Chair, and some conversation having taken place, the committee of management, who had necessarily been self-elected, were confirmed by the meeting in their office, and empowered to take such steps as they might think expedient for obtaining lectures to the industrious classes next winter. We understand that Dr Murray is to be entertained at supper, some evening next week, on the occasion of being presented with a piece of silver plate. It is with much regret we learn that John Grieve, Esq. of Newington Cottage, died on Monday last. He was beloved and esteemed for his estimable qualities by all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance, and his death will be long and deeply regretted. Rare Sights in London. –A young Scottish Miss, who had voyaged the length of London on a pleasure jaunt, returned the other day by one of the steamers, and was met on landing by various members of her family, who anxiously inquired what she had seen in London. Seen ! exclaimed the fair tourist I have seen such sights ! I saw the Theological Garden, and all the wild beasts in't! The Theatre.–Mr C. Kean concluded his engagement on Thursday evening–an engagement the longest and most brilliant of any that our Theatre has witnessed for many years. Mr Kean has been with us for a whole month, and has succeeded in crowding the house almost every night. We understand that upwards of 30,000 persons have visited the theatre during his engagement–a number beyond that of any former period of equal duration. In that time he has appeared in some of the most arduous and difficult of Shakespeare's characters Hamlet, Richard, Macbeth, Othello, Shylock, and King John, investing each with its own peculiar charms and interest, and exciting the highest admiration and astonishment at the versatility and power of his genius, which could give such individuality and truth to so many dissimilar, distinct, and separate classes of characters. The play with which his engagement concluded was Richard, which character he has performed seven times during his engagement ; the house was, as usual, crowded in every part, and he exerted himself most strenuously and successfully. At the conclusion the cheers of the audience were loud and long, and two laurel wreaths were thrown upon the stage from different parts of the house. Mr K. being loudly called for, appeared in front of the stage, and delivered the following very neat and appropriate address:– Ladies and Gentlemen, –I now stand before you for the last time this season, but believe me whichever way my pilgrimage may bend, my thoughts will ever recur to Edinburgh as those of a child to its distant home, fondly anticipating the hour when he shall again stand upon its threshold. (Great cheering.) Till that period permit me with a heavy, but a grateful heart, to pronounce that melancholy word– farewell. (Mr Kean then withdrew amidst reiterated and enthusiastic plaudits from all parts of the house.) –Mr K. we perceive, appears next in Aberdeen, where the people are anticipating a rich treat from his performances. The boxes there, we are told, are already taken for several successive nights to come.– Mrs Honey, from the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, makes her appearance here on Monday first. On Wednesday evening, Mr John G. Moxey, baker, Castle Street, was entertained at supper, in Menzie's Hotel and Tavern, Waterloo Place, by a party of friends, of about fifty in number, previous to his leaving this country for America, to which he is about to emigrate. The company was very harmonious, and the compliment must have been very gratifying to Mr Moxey. Qualifications of General Assembly Elders. –The Presbytery of Cupar, at their meeting on the 29th ult. elected the Earl of Leven and Melville, and Walter Malcolm, Esq. Edinburgh, to represent them in the ensuing Assembly. Mr Malcolm is factor for Captain Hay of Mugdrum, who is principal heritor in the parish of Newburgh, and was lately ordained an elder there. Against his election to serve in the Assembly a protest and appeal were taken, on the grounds, as we understand, that he has no domicile within the bounds of Presbytery, and is not an officiating elder; the protesters allowing that his election, though consistent with the letter, is contrary to the spirit of an act of Assembly passed in 1816. If the appeal is sustained, it is evident that a large proportion of the Assembly elders must vacate their seats. Intimation also was given by D. Maitland M'Gill, Esq., that when the commissions came to be attested, he would move for evidence being produced that the elders-elect maintain family worship. An amusing inquiry was instituted in the Presbytery last year respecting the Earl of Leven's habits of domestic devotion ; and a clerical member had the candour to say, he should wish to know how it was with the ministers themselves in that respect. The University of St Andrews has just conferred the degree of Doctor of Divinity on the Rev. Professor Paxton, of Edinburgh. In bestowing this public honour on one, who, during a long and useful life, has done so much for the cause of literature and religion, the members of the College have done an act which shows that they can appreciate real merit, and which will entitle them to the gratitude of the religious public of Scotland. Those who have had the good fortune to enjoy the public ministrations of Professor Paxton, and even the general church-going community, are well aware of the rich and glowing eloquence, of the pious and heartfelt warmth, and of the classical elegance which have long characterised his public preaching. Even beyond the religious body of which he is the ornament, he is well known as one of the most popular and impressive teachers of the day. In his lectures on Theology, as Professor to the General Associate Synod, and afterwards to the Associate Synod, he displayed the results of an extensive and profound critical study of the Scriptures, and of an unwearied research into the Natural History, and the manners and usages of the ancients nations. The work by which he is chiefly known as an author– The Illustrations of Scripture –will long bear testimony to the extent of his learning, and of his Oriental investigations, and to his powers of lucid and eloquent composition. We understand that the attention of the College was directed to Mr Paxton's merits by the distinguished Professor of Oriental Languages. This anxiety to do justice to a fellow labourer in the same field of study, reflects high honour on the discrimination and the heart of Mr Tennant. Public Dinner to Professor Dick. –On Tuesday last, the Students ofthe Edinburgh Veterinary College and a number of Veterinary Surgeons and other gentlemen (in all upwards of 70) from various parts of Scotland, entertained Professor Dick to a public dinner in the Waterloo Hotel. John Lambert, Esq. in the Chair, and Alexander Gordon, jun Esq. croupier. The stewards were Ed. Pyper, Esq. of West Craigs, J. R. Laing, Esq. jun of Dunkenny, Samuel Wordsworth, jun. Esq. W.S., Dr Malcolm, James Miller, Esq. and George Rennie, Esq.– Amongst the gentlemen present we observed Professors Low and Lizars ; Drs Robertson, Spittal, Knox, and Aitken, Mr Ferguson, surgeon ; J. B. Murdoch, Esq. of Coldoch; Charles Gordon, Esq. Secretary to the Highland Society of Scotland ; A. T. Blackwood, Esq. of Oggs Castle ; Mr Dick, senior &c. The cloth having been removed and the usual loyal toasts drank, the chairman, in a neat and appropriate speech, proposed the health of Professor Dick, to whom the present meeting had assembled to do honour, and who at once commanded their esteem as a member of society and their admiration as a man of talent, which toast was drank with the greatest enthusiasm. The chairman then proposed his Grace the Duke of Gordon and the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, Patrons of the Edinburgh Veterinary College, which was followed by a variety of other appropriate toasts. Many excellent songs were sung, and the conviviality of the evening was kept up until a late hour. Royal Infirmary –We understand that the Stewards of the late Fancy Ball for the benefit of the Royal Infirmary have, by their judicious arrangements in the management of the ball, been enabled to pay over to the trustees of that institution, (after deducting all expenses) the sum of t432, 7s. 8d. The managers of the Infirmary, as well as the public at large, are certainly much indebted to the gentlemen who acted as stewards upon that occasion, for their valuable extertions, particularly at the present time, in support of this great and useful institution, for the relief of those labouring under the united calamities of indigence and disease.  ID308 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1841 	12 	29 	inform 	Theatre Royal. –The Pantomine, we observe, is postponed till Friday. Meanwhile, the theatre is crowded nightly, the public being admitted at second price from the commencement of the performances. Music Hall. –We stated, about two month ago, that, in connection with other improvements in the Assembly Rooms, a plan was under consideration for erecting a Music Hall. We are now happy to announce, that at a meeting of the proprietors of the Rooms last week, full pwers were given to the Directors to take the requisite steps for carrying the design into execution. The desire so long felt by the cultivators of music here, will soon be realisd, by the erection of a splendid hall, constructed with a due regard to the accommodation both of professional men and the public, and with a minute attention to the most recent improvements, by which full effect is secured to musical performances when conducted on a grand scale. By what may be called a propitious coincidence, Mr Bishop, the new Professor of Music, arrived in Edinburgh on the very day when this resolution was come to. Martin's Paintings. –The exhibition of these celebrated paintings in this city has already, we believe, attracted many visitors. They are truly wonderful creations, and possess a power and grandeur of which the engravings, so familiar to the public, convey but a faint conception. In contemplating the Deluge, the spectator is so [?] [?] [?] the scene, that he is apt to overlook the details; but these will be found on inspection to be among the most interesting features of the picture. The groups of perishing beings are exquisitely wrought, while everything is made to contribute to the terrific grandeur of the catastrophe. The other two pictures–Pandemonium and the Rivers of Bliss, are smaller in size, but equally indicative of the high poetic genius of the artist. Nothing could be more striking than the contrast these pictures present to each other–the one fearful beyond expression, the other exhibiting a heavenly serenity and loveliness on which the eye rests with delight. There are several other valuable paintings in this collection, amongst which is The Offering Up of Isaac, a Rembrandt in fine preservation. Gordon's British Diorama. –This beautiful exhibition opened on Saturday last, and has, we understand, been crowded with visitors ever since. It will be seen by Mr Gordon's advertisement in to-day's paper, that the view of the Tower of London during the recent conflagration (to which we alluded in our last) has now arrived, and is being exhibited along with the other views. Broughton-place Congregation.–We understand that the call given by BroughtonPlace Congregation to the Rev. Mr Croon, Sanquhar, to be colleague to the Rev. Dr. Brown, has not been accepted, owing to the strong claims which the affectionate people among whom he presently labours have to continuance of his services, and his unfitness, as he alleges, for a charge so laborious; a result which, we learn, has caused among the members of Broughton-Place extreme and general regret. Cooke's Equestrian Amphitheatre, Leith. –Mr Cooke has generously handed over to the Provost, for the benefit of the Destitute Sick Society, the handsome sum of t15; being the free proceeds of Friday evening's entertainment, which took place under the patronage of the Provost and Magistrates. Captain Ross' Discoveries. –Extracts from Captain Ross' despatches have been published in a Parliamentary paper. From the map which accompanies the paper, we gain a more distinct idea of his track than the previous article copied from the Athenean[?] afforded. South Victoria Land, which he discovered, extends in latitude from 70 1/2 south to 79, how much farther is unknown; and in longitude its eastern coast lies between 163 and 171. Its position is directly south from New Zealand, and at the distance of 1500 geographical miles. The length of the part seen was fully 500 miles. It was girt with a border of ice many miles in breadth, which rendered it inaccessible. The passage southward was closed at latitude 78 by a barrier of ice 150 feet high, which was traced for 300 miles east from Victoria Land. Icebergs were encountered in numbers after they passed parallel of 63, and pack ice at 66. The land rose in lofy peaks from 9000 to 12,000 feet in height, perfectly covered with eternal snow; the glaciers descended from near the mountain summits, project many miles into the ocean, and presented a perpendicular face of lofty cliffs. They could not reach the mainland, but landed on an island, which they found to consist of volcanic rocks. On 28th January, in latitude 77 1/2, longitude 169 E., they discovered a magnificent volcano, emitting smoke and flame in a splendid profusion, and named it Mount Erebus. An extinct one near it was named after the other vessel, Mount Terror. At the distance of less than half a mile from the ice cliffs which barred their progress southward, they had sound ings with 318 fathoms. These cliffs, no doubt, reached the bottom, and, including the 150 feet above water, must have had an elevation fo 2000 feet of thereabout. The observations on the dip and declination induced them to place the South Magnetic Pole in latitude 76, and east longitude 153; and they considered its position as well ascertained as if they had reached it, though their nearest approach to it was a point 160 miles from it, on the east coast of Victoria Land. The pole is probably within that region, though this cannot be positively affirmed, as its western boundary is unknown. The highest latitude they reached 78. 4. They were therefore only 12 degrees from the pole and about 4 degrees nearer to it than Captain Weddel[?], the most successful of their predecessors. The Non-intrusion Disclosures. –In the Advertiser of yesterday there is a letter from J. M. Hog, Esq. of Newliston, and another from the Rev. Dr Simpson of Kirknewton, both expressing their extreme surprise at the letter of Mr Hamilton (which appeared in our last), and strongly disclaiming all connexion with it on the part of the General Assembly's Committee. Sabbath Observance–The Sweetie Case. –We understand that the Government of Prussia, thinking that the mode of keeping the Sabbath in that country was in some respects too lax, recently sent over a person to this country, to learn whether our practise in Britain would not furnish hints for improvement. Unluckily, the very first specimens of our piety which met him were the sweetie case, and that of the poor man Key who was excommunicated for burying his child on Sunday. These will of course figure in the very front of the officer's report as the natural fruits of our system, and we may guess what their effect will be in reconciling the Germans to a stricter observance of Sunday! We can, moreover, inform Butters' prosecutors, that the fame of their exploits has already travelled, by the aid of the Teutonic newspapers, to the uttermost parts of Germany, to the infinite amusement of the Swabian farmers, the Saxon miners, and the shepherds of the Riesengeberge. Key's case is no doubt destined to enjoy equal celebrity. Airdrie–Anti-Corn-Law Conference. – On Monday last, the members of the United Secession Church, Airdrie, favourable to a repeal of the Corn and Provision Laws, met, in compliance with the request of the Committee taking the active management of the Conference to be held in Edinburgh on the second week in January next on that subject, when they unanimously appointed their pastor, the Rev. Matthew M'Gavin, A.M., Mr John Craig Waddell, proprietor, and Mr James Forrester, merchant in Airdrie, to represent their sentiments at that meeting, which is looked forward to with great interest by the liberal portion of the inhabitants of the burgh. The Rev. Mr Taylor, with Messrs Adam Nimmo, contractor, and John Young, bookseller, will represent the Independent congregation; and Mr Thomas Muir, pastor of the Baptist church, will represent that body on that occasion. Kirkcudbright–Address to the Dean of Faculty, –We learn that at a meeting, held on the 17th current, of the Clerks and Procurators of the Steward and COmmissary Courts, an address was voted to Alexander Wood, Esq. on his appointment to the office of Dean of Faculty, and his retirement from that of Steward of Kirkcudbright. Distress in Paisley. –We understand that the Bookbinders of Edinburgh purpose to give a Grand Musical Melange in a few days, the proceeds of which are to be handed over to the committee for the distressed weavers in Paisley. Musselburgh. –Mr Wilson, Treasurer to the Honest Town, has, by the hands of the district committeesm collected from the contributors to the Prince of Wales fund, nearly t100; and the committees have already distributed 130 tons of coals to the necessitous families in the neighbourhood. Presbytery of Dalkeith–Case of Mr Monroe. –This Presbytery met on Tuesday the 21st current. At a former meeting an agent appeared for Mr Monroe, presentee to Fala, and laid on the table of Presbytery a presentation in his favour to the parish of Fala. It having been objected that the presentation, and some other papers relative thereton, bore, that Mr Monroe was presented merely to the parish of Fala, and not to the united parishes of Fala and Soutra, the agent made his appearance again at the meeting, which was held on Tuesday, with a supplementary presentation, and also a letter acceptance from Mr Monroe. The agent, when asked, admitted that he had not with him a Presbyterial certificate; and he stated, that he would not ask the Presbytery to sustain the presentation with relative papers at that meeting. But he intimated, that he intended to appear at the next meeting, which is appointed to be held on the 22d of February, and he expected to be able to show that the Presbytery should then sustain the presentation and relative documents. Splendid Meteor. –On Tuesday evening, about eight o'clock, a meteor of unusal size and splendour was witnessed in this quarter. The evening was very clear, the sky being without a cloud, and the moon shining brightly. Suddenly, a dazzling blaze of light burst from the sky, illuminating Benlomond and the distant hills, the Curse around Craigforth, and, indeed, the earth and air on every side as far as the eye could reach, with all the brilliancy of noon-day. The phenomenon appeared like a ball of fire, of an oblong shape, and apparently almost twice the size of the moon, having at the time somewhat of the same silvery appearance as that luminary, but flaming with a brilliancy so intense as almost to dazzle the eyes. A tail of fire somewhat resembling that of a rocket, but composed of the most beautifully varied colours, streamed behind it for a short distance, adding much to its spendour, and giving the whole an appearance at once singularly magnificent and sublime. Before it disappeared, it assumed a red glowing appearance, and then burst for an instant enveloping the earth and sky in a blaze as bright and dazzling as the most vivid lightning. It appeared to pass from the south to the north, inclining towards the earth. To the eye it seemed to burst and disappeared above Gargunnock. Another meteor of the same kind, but much less in size, brilliancy, and splendour, was observed falling in a quartr rather farther to the south, a few minutes previously. It is a coincidence worthy of notice, that a meteor, of the same nature with that first described in the above, was seen at the same hour in Glasgow.– Stirly Journal. Glasgow. –The collection made on Sabbath afternoon last, by the Rev. Mr Macfarlane's congregation, Nicholson Street, Glasgow, amounted to t46, 7s. 6d. This sum is the more praiseworthy when it is considered that this congregation has within a few months subscribed among themselves nearly t1000 for the erection of their beautiful place of worship to be called Erskine Church, of which they are erelong to take possession. The Unemployed in Paisley.–The number of unemployed in Paisley has last week decreased by 43. In Kilbarchan and Barrhead they were still on the increase. The following is the official report of yesterday for Paisley and Barrhead :– Paisley. Males, 1865 Dependants, 4662 –6527 Females, 1680 Dependants, 3360 –5040 Total, 11,567 Barrhead. December 17, 287 ... 23, 346 Increase, 59 – Paisley Advertiser. The Paisley Manufacturing Committee. –This Committee continue to carry on their operations with energy and zeal. The amount of the fund now exceeds t8000, and is still on the increase. They have given out about 700 webs already, and are as busy as possible preparing more. Unable to get a sufficiency of webs warped in Paisley, they have sent for assistance in this respect both to Glasgow and Johnstone. A good deal of work has this week been given to warpers, winders and heddle-casters. They have taken much more spacious premises in Gilmour Street, in order that they may the more easily supply both town and country weavers. It is desirable that the implement fund should be somewhat enlarged, as the other funds of the Committee are not trenched on for that purpose – Ibid. Ducal Generosity.–After the late county meeting at Hamilton, at which addresses were voted to the Queen and Prince Albert, his Grace the Duke of Hamilton and several of those who had attended the meeting visited the jail. One respectable looking female attracted his Grace's attention; and on inquiry he was told that she was the widow of a respectable wood merchant, now deceased, and had been confined for upwards of a year, at the instance of a law agent in Edinburgh, for costs incurred in a suit in the Court of Session. His Grace immediately caused the truth of the poor woman's story to be investigated, and on being satisfied of the facts he caused the debt to be paid by his factor, and procured the woman's liberation, who has thus through his Grace's generosity been restored to liberty and to the superintendence of her young family.– Reformers' Gazette. Presentation. –A number of the members of the United Secession Church, Airdrie, met in their vestry on the evening of Wednesday the 22d inst. when Councillor Brown, in name of the congregation, presented the Rev. M. M'Gavin, A.M., their pastor, with a handsome pulpit gown and cassock, as a mark of their respect and esteem; after which a number of the influential members of the congregation entertained him to supper supper in Mr Witherspoon's King's Arms Inn– Mr Daniel Gray, collector, Coltness Railway, in the chair, and Dr Clarkson, croupier–when the evening was spent in the most friendly, happy, and intellectual manner. A Rescue.–Last week, while the Duke of Hamilton was riding along the wood leading from Hamilton to Bothwell, he heard the screams of a female, and on looking towards the place whence the cries came, he perceived a stout Irishman belabouring a woman in a most unmerciful style. No sooner did he observe this, than he rode up to the scene of cruelty, dismounted from his horse, knocked the savage down, rescued the woman, and sent her home rejoicing, with more money in her pocket than it may have been her lot to possess for a long time. When we recollect that his Grace was born so long ago as October 1767, and so is in his 75th year, we cannot sufficiently admire his gallantry, humanity, and intrepidity– Glasgow Chronicle. Town Council. –The usual meeting of Council did not take place yesterday in consequence of the Christmas holidays. House of Industry. –We understand that Miss Grace Bailie had left a legacy to the Edinburgh House of Industry of ten pounds sterling. Old Church.–The Lords of her Majesty's Treasury have officially intimated to the parties interested their intention to adhere to the original arrangement made with the Town Council, for altering the Assembly Aisle, and rendering it fit to be permanently used as a place of worship for the accomodation of one of the city congregations. Prince of Wales Fund. –In the table of sums subscribed in the different Wards of Police, published in our paper of Saturday last, that indicated for the 26th Ward was t120, 12s. 9d. Mr Lindores, the General Commissioner, requests us to state, that the sum subscribed in his Ward was t275, 12s. 9d., and that the difference between the two sums is the amount of the very handsome subscriptions by the Banks in St Andrew Square, and which were drawn by the Treasurer. Presentation of Plate. –On Friday afternoon, about fifty citizens entertained Mr William Donaldson, of the Albion Cloth Company, to an elegant dinner and dessert, in the Turf Hotel, Princes Street, for the purpose of presenting him with a testimonial of their esteem, subscribed for by the members of the Celtic Lodge, and other private friends. Mr William Wright, hat manufacturer, was in the chair, supported on the right and left by the guest of the evening, Mr Pritchard of the Theatre-Royal, and other gentlemen. Mr Dick of the Albion officiated as croupier. After the usual loyal and preliminary toasts had been given, the chairman called for a bona fide bumper for the toast of the evening, and, after passing a handomse eulogium on those various qualities of their guest which had endeared him to all his friends, neighbours, and acquaintances, far and wide, presented to Mr Donaldson, in the name of the subscribers, a very elegant and massive silver tea set, of the value of t50. Mr Donaldon's health was then proposed and drunk with warm and friendly enthusiasm. The presentee replied to the compliment in modest and appropriate terms. The company spent an exceedingly happy and convivial night; the chairman and croupier taking care that there should be no flagging in the jovialty. The toasts were suitable to the occasion. Mr Mackenzie's instrumental band played appropriate airs to the various toasts and sentiments; and vocal music, from amateurs, was never wanting; the guest himself being a host in that department. The following inscription is neatly engraved on the various pieces of playe :–To Mr William Donaldson, R.W.M. of the Lodge Celtic of Edinburgh and Leith, from a number of Masonic and other Friends.–24th Dec. 1841. Theft and Recovery of a Pony. –At a late hour on Sunday night a gentleman residing in the southern part of the town dismounted from his pony at his own gate, and proceeding inwards, leaving the animal to follow, as he was wont to do, to the stable. On looking about, he observed a young man, whom he supposed to be his son, take the reins and mount the pony. Shortly afterwards the son came into the house, and the question of Where is the pony? soon convinced the parties that it was stolen. They immediately proceeded in search, and while the gentleman was giving information at the Police-Office, his son discovered the pony with a rider on the North Bridge. He immediately seized the reins and made a clutch at the thief; but the latter very adroitly threw himself off at the opposite side, ran down the Fleshmarket stairs, and escaped. Providential Recovery. –One day last week, a fine little child, about five years of age, belonging to one of the villagers at Ratho, having dandered[?] away with another little play-fellow, like himself, to a little distance from the house, fell into a deep well. His companion was found standing weeping at the edge. The apparently dead body of the little one being got out, was taken home, and all hopes of its recovery given up, when Dr Pringle, and excellent young gentleman, who is presently assistant of Dr Craig at Ratho, made his appearance, and, by applying himself with indefatiguable perseverance, succeeded in recalling the apparently extinguished spark. The next the little romp was as lively as ever. Mungo Park. –A public meeting was held in the town hall of Selkirk, on Monday the 26th current, the Chief Magistrate in the chair; when various resolutions were adopted with the view of erecting a monument or other permanent mark of respect for the memory of this celebrated traveller. Thimble-Riggers. –A band of thimble-riggers from Edinburgh have for several weeks past been infesting the roads in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. They are six in number and one of them, an old man of rather respectable appearance, is generally in advance of the party, and having got into conversation with a passenger on the road, and the others running up, and desiring the old man to try his luck; he does so, and winning a trifle, he easily persuades the person with whom he has been ingratiating himself to try also, and he is soon robbed of his whole spare cash. Information having, on Wednesday last, been given to the Procurator-Fiscal at Pollokshaws, and the gang were on the new Kilmarnock Road, he immediately despatched two rural police officers in pursuit of them. On the officers coming up to the gang, they separated and ran off, but the officers captured two of them (the old man and another), who were safely lodged in Pollokshaws Jail; and having been brought before two of the Justices, and several person having sworn to being defrauded by them of their money, they were sentenced tothirty days' imprisonment in Paisley House of Correction, with hard labour, as rogues and vagabonds; and an active look-out is made by the police for the remainder of the gang. Stoppage of Payments by the Town of Paisley. –Partly on account of the great depression of trade, and partly on account of a run raised by the circulation of malicious and false statements regarding the affairs of the community of Paisley, theTown Council, at a meeting on Wednesday evening, ordered the Chamberlain to susspend receipt or payment of deposits, in the meantime, but to proceed with all possible despatch in realizing the outstanding debts due to the community for the regular payment of the interest on the money borrowed, and other current engagements of the burgh. It is pretty generally known that a small portion of the would-be-political leaders of the town who have not the influence to get themselves placed in municipal authority, have for a good number of years endeavoured to embarass the party in power, by attacking the credit of the community. The unfavourabout state of trade and the leniency of the Council in not enforcing during the last year the exactions on the owners of property, for entries, &c. falling due, caused a deficiency of nearly t300 in the usual amount of revenue. This simple circumstance was taken advantage of, though nothing was lost thereby, and statements prejudicial to the town's credit were placed in the hands of every credito that could be found by the individuals referred to, and thus uncalled for alarm raised. In addition to this, the adherents of the same party in the Council during the last five days gave currency to another statement which they knew to be quite untrue, about the late Provost having commenced to secure himself by drawing a thousand pounds, when the fact was he had not drawn out a penny. From the position to which which the affiars the town are now driven a full and public exposure of these matters will soon be submitted to the creditors. The Council have been negotiating for such a loan of money as will pay off those who are dissatisfied, which in the ordinary state of the money market they would long since have obtained, though at present that is difficult. As regards risk to the creditors, from the best informed quarters we are assured there is none. More than one-third of the whole debts of the town are due to the Bank and the members of Council, or their immediate friends, and fully a half of the debt against the river is due to the same parties. This we should conceive the strongest proof that could be adduced of the confidence of those who should best know the state of the town's affairs.– Glasgow Chronicle. Disgraceful Trick.–At a late wake in the country, a short way from Crieff, a waggish fellow tied a cord secretly to the neck of the corpse and while a number of young men and women present were going on merrily with some sport the wag pulled the cord, when corpse started up in the bed, making the clothes to fly off; the whole party rushed to the door, crying for mercy upon them, and knocking each other over in the hurry, when at length some people came to their assistance, who afterwards discovered the cause of their terror.– Perth Courier. The Church Question. –Long ago, Dr Chalmers let out the secret of the clerical movement, by declaring that very little of Non-intrustion would satisfy him and his friends, provided the independent power of the Church were secured. Now, this liberum arbitrium does nothing at all for Non-intrusion; but it does a great deal for Church Independence. It confers no privilege on the laity; but it adds immeasurably to the power of the clergy. It is, in fact, the very worst part of the claims that have been advanced by the Church; and its effects would simply be to sacrifice the lay Non-intrusionists on the one hand, and clerical Moderates on the other. It means literally uncontrolled power to the Church The General Steam Navigation Company's ship Monarch, Captain Fraser, arrived at Granton from London on Monday evening at half-past nine o'clock. Election of a Minister for Old Monk- land. –The election of a minster took place at Old Monkland Church, on Thursday the 23d inst., and the right of patronage being vested in the Heritors and Kirk-Session, the election might be considered a popular one. About 150 voters attended the meeting, and a decided wish having been expressed by, it is understood, the whole of the heritors that no candidate known to be connected with the Non-intrusion party in the Church should be chosen, the meeting, acting upon this principle, unanimously agreed to elect the Rev. Mr Johnston, Greenock, as minister of the parish. Considering the number of voters, the unanimity that prevailed among the electors, it is believed, is without precedent and stongly marks the sentiments and feelings of a large and very populous parish on the present proceedings of the dominant party in th Church. Mr Johnston was proposed by General Pye Douglass of Rosehall, seconded by Mr M'Caul of Daldowie, and unanimously elected.– Reformers' Gazette. Destructive Fire. –About three o'clock on the morning of the 25th curt., an alarm of fire was given at Balmangan Mill, in the parish of Rerwick. The premises are occupied by Mr Kissock, and despite the great exertions of himself, servants and neighbours, the work of destruction proceeded with a degree of rapidity that rendered it impossible to save a single article. The flames in their fury having charred the rafters, the roof fell in with a loud crash; and, before long, the entire mill, with the exception of the side walls, became an unbroken mass of ruins. The building contained a considerable quantity of grain and oatmeal, the property of the tacksman, all of which was unforunately destroyed. As the premises were found quite safe a very few hours previously, suspicion of incendiarism have naturally arisen, but no clue thus far has been found attaching guilt to a single individual. The fire, if wilful, implies the blackest malice, and it is sad to think that any one could have been so wicked as to destroy what thousands are in want of, and would gladly toil for, if they only knew how–daily bread– Dumfries Courier. Hamilton. –Some influential persons in Hamilton and the neighbourhood have subscribed to build an Episcopal chapel in that town. We have been informed that all the requisite arrangements have been made for carrying the views of the subscribers into effect. This is one effect of the conduct of the rebellious majority of the General Assembly. Many of thsoe now friendly to the scheme, never dreamed of espousing Episcopacy, till they have been driven in disgust from the Church of their fathers, by the conduct of their ministers; men who exist in their offices by law, and yet set that very law at defiance, in virtue of which they hold offices, and draw their temporalities, as they cantingly term their good things, which alone induce some of them, at least, to remain members of the venerable Establishment. Who would have believed, some years ago, that Black Prelacy was about to be established within sight of Bothwell Brigg!
