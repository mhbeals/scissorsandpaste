On the passage from Africa, nine of the seamen mutined, whom Captain Hunter has brought confined in irons, and they are to be tried at a Court of Admiralty Sessions. Feb. 20. Very strong suspicions are entertained by the Americans, that the Indian Chief M' Gilveray, and the nations under his immediate controul, or in alliance with him, are subsidied by the King of Spain. It is a well known fact, that they are regularly supplied with cloathing, arms and ammunition, from the Royal Magazines at St. Augustine and Pensacola, and therefore in all probability; the sword not the olive branch, will be the most speedy and effectual agent for terminating the disputes. March 6. Tuesday last arrived in the harbour of Port Royal, from Cork, his Majesty's ship Chichester, of 44 guns, armed en flute, Lieutenant Craven, Commander, having on board the first battalion of the first or Royal Regiment of of foot, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Dundas. The other Officers are–Captains, Duncan, Franer, Pemberton, and Mannoch; Lieutenants, Sir W. Jas. Cockburne, Bart. Nicholson, Puxley, Clunes, Browne, Clarke, Drummond, and Graham; Adjutant, Sir. W. J. Cockburne, Bart. Quartermaster, Mr. Davidson, Surgeon, MR. Young; Ma?e, Mr. Bolton. The troops in the Chicester amount to 500 men, exch??e of 100 women and children. Colonel Hunter is appointed superintendent of the settlement at the Bay of Honduras, in the room of Colonel Despard, recalled. Col. Hunter came out with the earl of Effingham; it is therefore probable that the disputes which have so long subsisted between Lieutenant Colonel Despard and the inhabitants of the Bay of Honoduras, will be brought to a speedy determination. At the sale of the late Peter Heningson's estate,a negro blacksmith was sold for the extraordinary sum of two hundred and sixty pounds! At two o'clock on Tuesday morning the 3d regiment quitted the barracks in this town and at Up Park Camp, and embarked on board the Chichester for Great Britain; the 14th at the same time taking possession of their quarters. Advice is received from St. Mark's in Hispaniola, that, on the 1st of this month, a number of free people of colour, to the amount of 700 and upwards, having possessed themselves of several field pieces, formed a camp in that districh, and exhibited an appearance of hostility highly alarming. A deputation of five gentlemen being sent from the Assembly to demand the reason of so extraordinary a proceeding, the insurgents demanded, that a remonstrance which they then delivered to the deputies, should be presented imimmediately to the general, and that an answer thereto should be given without delay. The paper being conveyed as they desired, proved to be a sensible and well written detail of the various claims the free people of colour had on what they termed the justice of the whites, with whom they demanded an equal participation of all rights and immunities whatsoever–the privilege of representation, and of qualifying for all the learned professions–and concluding with the avowal of a determination to proceed to extremities should their demands be treat with neglect. On the perusal of this paper, it was judged adviseable to assemble a body of the militia, who headed by the General, immediately went against the camp. On their arrival the insurgents fired and fled to the mountains; three or four of the whites were killed, and one of the ringleaders was taken and instantly beheaded. A proclamation was then issued, offering a reward of 50 half joes for the head of any principal offender, and in the course of a few days not less than twenty seven were brought in. On Sunday the 7th instant, a very great majority of those who had formed the camp, finding all their attempts completely frustrated, came in and took the oath of allegiance to the nation. One or two of the principals, for whom high rewards are offered, are not yet taken. From Port Maria we have received the disagreeable account of the loss of the ship Lion, Capt. Smith, belonging to Liverpool: a violent breeze on the 5th instant drove her from her anchors, and she now lies stranded on the beach.
