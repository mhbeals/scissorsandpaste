It is stated, we believe upon good authority, that he accounts for this course of proceeding, by referring to the great probability of the Lords throwing out the Irish Municipal Bill. Burn's Monument. –We understand that there is now an early prospect of the completion of this monument, which has too long remained in an unfinished state, to the surprise of strangers, and the discredit to our Modern Athens. The sum already in the Treasurer's hands, aided by the profits of the handsome musical work lately issued by Mr M'Leod, which he has generously devoted to that purpose, is now nearly sufficient to meet the calculations of the expense requird for the railing in and decoration of the ground around the monument. We expect, therefore, that the work will forthwith be commenced, and if a few pounds are still wanted, we have no doubt there are hundreds in Edinburgh who would willingly guarantee the Treasurer against any loss by the immediate completion of the undertaking. Annuity Tax. –We understand that deputations from several places in the country, are expected to attend the public meeting which is to be held on Tuesday evening, for the purpose of petitioning Parliament for the abolition of the Annuity Tax, in order to testify their abhorrence of that system of politico Christianity which requires distraint and imprisonment for its support. We observe that Mr Gillon, of Wallhouse, M.P. is to take the chair. The meeting we doubt not, will be most numerously attended. Law of Scotland. –The prizes given by Professor Bell, for the greatest proficiency in the examinations, were yesterday awarded to Mr William Neish, 25, India Street, in the senior, and to William Spence, 31, Broughton Place, in the junior class. The following gentlemen also distinguished themselves in the competition : Mr John Fraser, James Gilchrist, James Mason, James Scott, in the senior class; James Oliver, David Gale, John R. Banks, James Charles Murray, Wm. M'Naughton, in the junior. Kilwinning, March 30.–The United Associate Presbytery of Kilmarnock met at Kilwinning on Tuesday, the 22d March, and ordained Mr A. Macgregor to the pastoral charge of the congregation in that place. The Rev. D. Henderson, of Dalry, preached and presided. The Rev. Mr Cairns, of Stewarton, ordained, and the Rev D. Ronald, of Saltcoats, gave the charge to the minister and congregation. On the Sabbath following, the Rev. Mr Tait, of Barrhead, introduced Mr Macgregor to his congregation ; and there is every prospect that the hitherto long disappointed congregation of Kilwinning will now prosper under the pastoral care of their much esteemed and highly talented young minister. Presentation of Plate. –Mr A. S. Walker, late of the Commercial Bank of Scotland, at present manager of the branch of the Commercial Bank of England, at Uttoxeter, in Staffordshire, was lately presented with an elegant tea service by the proprietors of that establishment, bearing the following inscription :– Presented to Mr Archibald S. Walker, by the Uttoxeter Proprietors of the Commercial Bank of England, as a small acknowledgement of his faithful and valuable services–March, 1836. This is another proof of the estimation in which many of the young men are held who have been trained to the banking system in this country. From a Return, just published, we find that the emigration to Canada has been comparatively small last year. The whole number of emigrants landed at Quebec and Montreal in 1835, was 12,527 : in 1831 and 1832 four times, and in 1834 two times as many were sent out. Of the 12,527, there were 5597 adult males, 3866 females, and 3064 children under 14 years. Of the whole number, 1043 were sent out by parochial aid. The numbers from the three kingdoms were– England, 3067 Ireland, 7,108 Scotland, 2,127 From Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, &c. 225 Settled in Lower Canada, 2,297 Upper Canada, 9,800 Died at Grosse Isle and Quebec, 13 Returned to the United Kingdom, 117 Removed to the United States, 300 –12,527 But besides those who went to Canada, 16,749 landed at New York, raising the whole number of emigrants to 29,376. There were no less than three vessels wrecked last year on their way to Quebec– the William Ewing from Londonderry with 300 passengers, all saved–the barque James from Newfoundland, all saved–and the Nathaniel Graham from Cork, with 48 persons on board, passengers and crew, of whom 41 were lost. From another part of the Report, we find that 2764 female emigrants were sent out to Australia last year, under the superintendence of the Emigration Committee. Of these 2105 had a free passage. The arrangements seem to have been ood ; for the mortality was small, and few complaints were made. The females were all of decent character, and due care was taken on their arrival to get them disposed of as servants, in situations where their morals would not be exposed to unnecessary risk. Ulster Railway. –Length 36 miles, from Belfast to Armagh ; capital t600,000, in 12,000 shares, of which t393,000 are subscribed. The number of passengers expected is 450,000; the expected income is t93,000, of which t67,800 is from passengers ; the estimated expense of the work is t539,000. The steepest gradient is 1 in 200. There are 3 tunnels of 310, 320, and 570 yards in length. East Lothian Railway. –We call attention with great pleasure to the Prospectus of a railway from Dunbar to Edinburgh, by Haddington and Tranent, which appears in our first page. No one can have travelled over the ground without observing how admirably it is fitted for this species of communication, by its remarkable uniformity of surface. We should have doubted whether such a work would pay, had it terminated at Edinburgh ; but as a part of an unbroken line reaching across the most fertile and populous parts of Scotland, from the German ocean to the Atlantic, its chances of success are vastly increased. Dundee and Arbroath Railway. –The Committee's report on this railway has reached us, but we must confine ourselves to an abstract. The length is 16 miles 5 furlongs and 90 yards ; the capital t100,000, divided into 4000 shares, which is all subscribed, but authority is taken to raise t40,000 more by loan ; sum paid up t5000 ; subscribed by shareholders locally interested t88,900, by others t7150 : there are three subscribers for t2000 and upwards : the expected income from passengers is t16,912, goods t14,654, from both t31,566. There are no tunnels, no inclined planes, and the steepest gradient being only 1 in 1000, scarcely differs from a dead level. It does not cross any highway or turnpike on a level. The estimated expenses is t99,844. Statute Labour Acts. –It appears from the votes of the House of Commons, that a Select Committee has been appointed to investigate the Scottish Statute Labour Acts, and to consider what amendments may be made thereon. It may be stated, that by the present act for this county, proprietors of land, and several other descriptions of people are totally exempted from any burden, on account of the coaches, chaises, gigs, or saddle horses they may keep, though it is quite plain good roads are of as much advantage to them as to the occupiers of land, upon whom almost the sole burden is thrown. In many parishes a considerable addition would be made to the road funds, were no such exemptions allowed. At present the management is vested in heritors, rated at one hundred pounds Scots and upwards, though it is stated with confidence, that were the occupiers of land included, beneficial consequences would follow.– East- Lothian Correspondent. Leith Mechanics' Friendly Assurance Society. – The fifth annual meeting of this Institution was held on Tuesday last–John Hutton, Esq., one of the Honorary Members, President of the Society, in the chair. A very satisfactory report for the last year was read, and thanks were voted to the different Office bearers. It appears that this society was established under the countenance of the Magistrates and Ministers, and various influential individuals in Leith, and is well deserving of encouragement, as affording the benefits of mutual insurance to the working classes, the lowest rates consistent with perfect security. The funds, we understand, are in a prosperous state. Hay and Straw. –In consequence of it having been alleged last Wednesday, that higher prices were got for straw than those quoted, we have made due inquiry, and find there are no grounds for such an allegation. We have been further assured, that in reporting the prices of hay and straw for these two years past, the clerk of the corn market has never shown a desire to favour the farm servants at the expense of their employers, or to favour either party at the expense of the public. The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have been pleased to grant by their warrant, dated the 6th of April 1836, a distinguishing flag to be worn by the respective vessels belonging to the Eastern Regatta Club of Scotland, viz. a blue cornet flag, with a white St Andrew's cross on the upper quarter on a red field. Heriot's Hospital. –At the meeting of the Governors of George Heriot's Hospital, on Thursday the 7th instant, the estimate of Messrs Trotter for alterations and repairs on the chapel, amounting to t935, was accepted, and it will gratify the friends of economy to learn, that this is t65 under the sum voted by a majority of the Governors for that purpose some time ago. Thereafter a unanimous vote of thanks was passed to Councillor Gillespie Graham, for gratuitously furnishing a plan of the intended improvements on the chapel, which was described by Councillor Grant and others, as highly creditable to the skill and good taste of that distinguished architect. The Governors then proceeded to consider the list of applications for admission of boys, preparatory to the usual half-yearly election. There were 16 vacancies and 37 applicants, who may be thus classed :– Those who have never received benefit from George Heriot's Hospital, or any other institution, 12 Those who have received benefit for one child, 13 Do. for two children, 6 Do. for three children, 5 Do. for five children, 1 37 In considering cases the present practise of the Governors is to give preference, first to children of widows (being poor), then to those who have never received benefit, afterwards those who have had only one child in, and so on. These were but three applications for widow's children, and one for an orphan, out of the above number, and it is therefore probable, considering the large population of Edinburgh, that it is not sufficiently known, that George Heriot, in his will, expressly points out the fatherless and poor, being children of burgesses and freemen, as the objects of his charity–hence, if there be not a sufficient numbers of really necessitous cases, the Governors, in filling up the vacancies, may elect some that do not appear to have strong claims, simply from those that have such claims not coming forward in sufficient numbers. Political Economy. –On Thursday last the course of lectures on Political Economy, delivered by Dr Thomas Murray, in Elder Street Chapel, was brought to a conclusion ; on which occasion the thanks of the meeting were, on the motion of one of the members of committe, voted by acclamation to the lecturer for his valuable services. After thanks had been returned by Dr Murray, Mr A. G. Hunter, merchant, was called to the Chair, and some conversation having taken place, the committee of management, who had necessarily been self-elected, were confirmed by the meeting in their office, and empowered to take such steps as they might think expedient for obtaining lectures to the industrious classes next winter. We understand that Dr Murray is to be entertained at supper, some evening next week, on the occasion of being presented with a piece of silver plate. It is with much regret we learn that John Grieve, Esq. of Newington Cottage, died on Monday last. He was beloved and esteemed for his estimable qualities by all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance, and his death will be long and deeply regretted. Rare Sights in London. –A young Scottish Miss, who had voyaged the length of London on a pleasure jaunt, returned the other day by one of the steamers, and was met on landing by various members of her family, who anxiously inquired what she had seen in London. Seen ! exclaimed the fair tourist I have seen such sights ! I saw the Theological Garden, and all the wild beasts in't! The Theatre.–Mr C. Kean concluded his engagement on Thursday evening–an engagement the longest and most brilliant of any that our Theatre has witnessed for many years. Mr Kean has been with us for a whole month, and has succeeded in crowding the house almost every night. We understand that upwards of 30,000 persons have visited the theatre during his engagement–a number beyond that of any former period of equal duration. In that time he has appeared in some of the most arduous and difficult of Shakespeare's characters Hamlet, Richard, Macbeth, Othello, Shylock, and King John, investing each with its own peculiar charms and interest, and exciting the highest admiration and astonishment at the versatility and power of his genius, which could give such individuality and truth to so many dissimilar, distinct, and separate classes of characters. The play with which his engagement concluded was Richard, which character he has performed seven times during his engagement ; the house was, as usual, crowded in every part, and he exerted himself most strenuously and successfully. At the conclusion the cheers of the audience were loud and long, and two laurel wreaths were thrown upon the stage from different parts of the house. Mr K. being loudly called for, appeared in front of the stage, and delivered the following very neat and appropriate address:– Ladies and Gentlemen, –I now stand before you for the last time this season, but believe me whichever way my pilgrimage may bend, my thoughts will ever recur to Edinburgh as those of a child to its distant home, fondly anticipating the hour when he shall again stand upon its threshold. (Great cheering.) Till that period permit me with a heavy, but a grateful heart, to pronounce that melancholy word– farewell. (Mr Kean then withdrew amidst reiterated and enthusiastic plaudits from all parts of the house.) –Mr K. we perceive, appears next in Aberdeen, where the people are anticipating a rich treat from his performances. The boxes there, we are told, are already taken for several successive nights to come.– Mrs Honey, from the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, makes her appearance here on Monday first. On Wednesday evening, Mr John G. Moxey, baker, Castle Street, was entertained at supper, in Menzie's Hotel and Tavern, Waterloo Place, by a party of friends, of about fifty in number, previous to his leaving this country for America, to which he is about to emigrate. The company was very harmonious, and the compliment must have been very gratifying to Mr Moxey. Qualifications of General Assembly Elders. –The Presbytery of Cupar, at their meeting on the 29th ult. elected the Earl of Leven and Melville, and Walter Malcolm, Esq. Edinburgh, to represent them in the ensuing Assembly. Mr Malcolm is factor for Captain Hay of Mugdrum, who is principal heritor in the parish of Newburgh, and was lately ordained an elder there. Against his election to serve in the Assembly a protest and appeal were taken, on the grounds, as we understand, that he has no domicile within the bounds of Presbytery, and is not an officiating elder; the protesters allowing that his election, though consistent with the letter, is contrary to the spirit of an act of Assembly passed in 1816. If the appeal is sustained, it is evident that a large proportion of the Assembly elders must vacate their seats. Intimation also was given by D. Maitland M'Gill, Esq., that when the commissions came to be attested, he would move for evidence being produced that the elders-elect maintain family worship. An amusing inquiry was instituted in the Presbytery last year respecting the Earl of Leven's habits of domestic devotion ; and a clerical member had the candour to say, he should wish to know how it was with the ministers themselves in that respect. The University of St Andrews has just conferred the degree of Doctor of Divinity on the Rev. Professor Paxton, of Edinburgh. In bestowing this public honour on one, who, during a long and useful life, has done so much for the cause of literature and religion, the members of the College have done an act which shows that they can appreciate real merit, and which will entitle them to the gratitude of the religious public of Scotland. Those who have had the good fortune to enjoy the public ministrations of Professor Paxton, and even the general church-going community, are well aware of the rich and glowing eloquence, of the pious and heartfelt warmth, and of the classical elegance which have long characterised his public preaching. Even beyond the religious body of which he is the ornament, he is well known as one of the most popular and impressive teachers of the day. In his lectures on Theology, as Professor to the General Associate Synod, and afterwards to the Associate Synod, he displayed the results of an extensive and profound critical study of the Scriptures, and of an unwearied research into the Natural History, and the manners and usages of the ancients nations. The work by which he is chiefly known as an author– The Illustrations of Scripture –will long bear testimony to the extent of his learning, and of his Oriental investigations, and to his powers of lucid and eloquent composition. We understand that the attention of the College was directed to Mr Paxton's merits by the distinguished Professor of Oriental Languages. This anxiety to do justice to a fellow labourer in the same field of study, reflects high honour on the discrimination and the heart of Mr Tennant. Public Dinner to Professor Dick. –On Tuesday last, the Students ofthe Edinburgh Veterinary College and a number of Veterinary Surgeons and other gentlemen (in all upwards of 70) from various parts of Scotland, entertained Professor Dick to a public dinner in the Waterloo Hotel. John Lambert, Esq. in the Chair, and Alexander Gordon, jun Esq. croupier. The stewards were Ed. Pyper, Esq. of West Craigs, J. R. Laing, Esq. jun of Dunkenny, Samuel Wordsworth, jun. Esq. W.S., Dr Malcolm, James Miller, Esq. and George Rennie, Esq.– Amongst the gentlemen present we observed Professors Low and Lizars ; Drs Robertson, Spittal, Knox, and Aitken, Mr Ferguson, surgeon ; J. B. Murdoch, Esq. of Coldoch; Charles Gordon, Esq. Secretary to the Highland Society of Scotland ; A. T. Blackwood, Esq. of Oggs Castle ; Mr Dick, senior &c. The cloth having been removed and the usual loyal toasts drank, the chairman, in a neat and appropriate speech, proposed the health of Professor Dick, to whom the present meeting had assembled to do honour, and who at once commanded their esteem as a member of society and their admiration as a man of talent, which toast was drank with the greatest enthusiasm. The chairman then proposed his Grace the Duke of Gordon and the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, Patrons of the Edinburgh Veterinary College, which was followed by a variety of other appropriate toasts. Many excellent songs were sung, and the conviviality of the evening was kept up until a late hour. Royal Infirmary –We understand that the Stewards of the late Fancy Ball for the benefit of the Royal Infirmary have, by their judicious arrangements in the management of the ball, been enabled to pay over to the trustees of that institution, (after deducting all expenses) the sum of t432, 7s. 8d. The managers of the Infirmary, as well as the public at large, are certainly much indebted to the gentlemen who acted as stewards upon that occasion, for their valuable extertions, particularly at the present time, in support of this great and useful institution, for the relief of those labouring under the united calamities of indigence and disease.
