        ID1Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18110826informExtract of a letter. The population of Canada, in 1760, was reckoned at 62,000 souls, whilst her exports had never exceeded two millions of livres tournois (about 90,000l) The imports must have greatly exceeded the exports ; but not even a conjecture of the differences can be formed. The present population of the Canadas may be rated at 320,000 souls ; but great as this augmentation may appear, commerce will be found to have greatly surpassed the proportional ratio of the population. From 1763 to 1793, the exports may have varied from 120,000l. to 300,000l. chiefly of wheat, furs, and peltry. But, during the last 18 years, they have increased to the surprising sum of 1,220,963l. 10s. Sterling, as we shall presently perceive by the following estimate, which cannot be much over or under the truth :- Furs and skims ... 105,000 0 Wheat, all other grain, flour, and biscuit 136,500 0 Lumber of all descriptions ... 536,500 0 Pot and pearl ashes ... 223,000 0 Beets and pork 30,000 0 Sundries (too tedious to particularise) ... 16,000 10 The hulls, masts, and yards, of 28 ves sels built in the province ... 84,000 0 Total of domestic produce 1,131,000 0 Sundry goods imported and exported 4,780 0 1,125,780 0 Commissions and additional charges at 7 1/2 per cent. Sterling ... 65,183 0 t. 1,220,963 The amounts of imports of dutiable articles at Quebec is about 380,000l. Sterling. It is impossible to ascertain the value of goods not dutiable ; but we may safely conlude, that they will make the total of import as one million Sterling, leaving a balance in favour of these provinces, which, but a few years ago, would have appeared incredible. This property is carried by 661 vessels, whose tonnage is 143,893, navigated by 6758 seamen. The freight and primage on these vessels are nine guineas per ton, being 1,359,788l. 17s. Sterling, which, without taking into consideration the charges in Britain, will make the gross amount of our cargoes landed, exceed 3,000,000l. Sterling, being about a tenth of the imports of the United Kingdom. Our commerce has become considerable with the United States. A few years ago, our imports from thence greatly exceeded our exports. But since respectable and intelligent American merchants have begun to settle amongst us, I believe the scale turned in our favour ; and thus British industry is commencing to run in a channel never before much thought of. international trade;anonymous letters;Canada--commerce
        ID102Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18020701informNew South Wales The following particulars respecting this flourishing colony will not be unacceptable to our readers :– We are informed by Lieutenant Grant, who is lately arrived from New South Wales, of the flourishing state of that colony ; he left Port Jackson in November last, when the crops were very luxuriant and beginning to be cut down, without having suffered that year from the floods. Governor King had opened a communication with Otaheite, for the purpose of supplying the colony with pork, in which he had been singularly successful his Majesty's armed ship Porpoise having made one trip, and the Norfolk brig having sailed on the same employ previous to Mr Grant's leaving Sydney. The most friendly understanding exists between the natives of Otaheite and the settlement of New South Wales. We are happy to hear that the latter country is longer in want of a staple commodity, the article of coals, of an excellent kind, being found in abundance in Hunter's River, together with plenty of wood, well qualified for the masting of shipping. Mr Grant made his passage to the Cape of Good Hope, round Cape Horn, in the brig Anna Josepha, loaded with spars for masts, and coals, which latter sold immediately at the Cape, at 36 rix dollars per ton (nearly 6l. sterling.) Governor King had formed a small settlement at Hunter's River, for the purpose of working the coal, which is of the same nature with that of Newcastle. Mr Grant entered this river in the Lady Nelson, in order to obtain the survey of it. He penetrated in his boats nearly seventy miles up the same, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Paterson, without being able at that time, to discover its source. A wood resemblingsustic had also been found. Mr Grant in his passage from England to Port Jackson, in the Lady Nelson, a vessel of only 60 tons burthen, with three sliding keels, and built on Captain Schank's construction, was the first that passed through the straits which separate Van Diemens Land from New Holland, and sailed along a great extent of coast to the westward of any land before seen by those who had visited that country, going into no higher latitude than 39. 30. fourth ; and observes, that the fourth cape of New Holland lies in 39. 2. fourth. He found those he sailed along bold, with very deep water, wherever he attempted to land ; and, in general, he had, with a very moderate offing, from 50 10 45, and 30 fathoms water, fine land, and sometimes shells. By order of Governor King, he returned into those straits, and obtained the survey of the coast from Wilson's Promontory to Western Port, with the survey of that harbour, which is well sheltered, and capable of containing many sail of shipping. There is abundance of wood easily to be got, and plenty of water ; though the latter is rather difficult to be procured, on account of the distance, and from several shoals lying in the way, which render it necessary to take advantage of tide. Mr Grant gives a very favourable report of that part of the country. settlement description;agriculture;international trade
        ID103Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18100609informCanada Extract of a letter from a Gentleman, to his Friend in Glasgow Quebec, March 23, 1810.–A number of leading characters among the Canadians, who were Members of the House of Assembly (twice dissolved for improper conduct) and the proprietor of a French paper, called La Canadien, have been arrested and thrown into jail, upon a charge of treasonable and seditious practises ; the printing press, types, &c. also taken possession of. This vigorous measure of Sir James Craig, has astonished the Canadians not a little, but the consequences will be no doubt beneficial to the country, as it has crushed a faction which has for some years been gaining strength, and acquiring dangerous influence over the minds of the inhabitants, who are without education, and ignorant, of course, in the extreme ; therefore easily misled by demagogues among their countrymen, who seize every opportunity of stirring up all those prejudices which the people of this country naturally have against the British : for, having been allowed to preserve their language, they are nearly as much Frenchmen now as they were at the conquest. Quebec, March 22.–On Sunday afternoon, the printer of the Canadien, Mr Charles Lafrancois was arrested and committed to jail, under a warrant from the Executive Council, on a charge of treasonable practises. On Monday evening, Dr Blanchet and Mr Bedard, and last evening Mr T. Taschereau, were also arrested, and committed by the same authority on the same charges. The Commander in Chief in Scotland gave an elegant dinner, at head-quarters, on the 4th curt. to celebrate the King's birthday-day–at which several of the Nobility and Gentry, Generals, and Field-Officers of the army, were present. Among the other accidents that occurred on the King's birth-day, from the imprudent use of gunpowder, is the death of girl in Richmond Street.– Her clothes were set fire by a squib, and, although immediately taken to the Infirmary, was so severely burnt, that she died before morning. A very melancholy accident happened at a place called the Pease, Berwickshire. As one of the baggage carts of the Forfarshire militia was stopping there, a fine boy about eight years of age, belonging to Serjeant-Major Nicol, got out of the cart, and was climbing on the wheel, when the horses suddengoing off, threw him on the ground, and the wheel passing over his body, crushed him to death. The unfortunate mother was upon the cart when this unhappy accident happened. On Thursday night, a spirit shop in Gibson-street, Glasgow, was broken into and about five pounds in silver, a seven shilling piece, about eight shillings of copper, a counterfeit half-guinea, and a pocket-book containing some bills and papers carried ; some partial payments are marked on the bills. The villains appear to have entered the shop by forcing up the window shutter with an iron bar, and then breaking a pane of glass, by which they got the iron bolts and the window opened. On Saturday last, a porter was killed in the hold of a vessel in Dundee harbour. He was engaged unloading coals ; and the rope by which the iron pully was supported, giving way, the measure fell down upon him, and killed him instantly. A few days ago, a mason, of the name of Stevenson, was killed by the blowing up of some stones, at Templeton, in the parish of Auchterhouse. The match unfortunately communicated too early to the powder, and the explosion took place before he could get out of the way. He has left a wife and two children to lament his loss. colonial government;newspapers;crime;accidents
        ID104Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18120829informMontreal, July 4 This city has been for a few days past in a state of agitation occasioned by an event which has taken place at Pointe Claire ; and as this matter will be clothed, no doubt, in all the dress of misrepresentatation by our neighbouring enemies, from the information they may receive of it, we consider it a duty, we owe to the community at large in this country, to state the circumstances as they occurred, in a fair, open, and candid manner. By the late militia law, 2000 young men are to be drafted from the general militia of the province for three months to be properly trained, and of course, a certain proportion of this number is to be furnished by each particular district. Some those drafted from the Parish of Pointe Claire refused to march to Lapraire, for the purpose of joining the division stationed there ; in consequence of which, Major, Leprohon, belonging to this particular battalion, was sent on Tuesday last, with 22 attendants, to apprehend these refractory persons as deserters. They apprehended four with some opposition ; and on their way to town with them, they were followed by a considerable number of persons who rescued one prisoner, and threatened that they would next day proceed to the depot at Lapraire, and bring away by force from thence the young men of the parish, who were there on duty. Accordingly, on Wednesday, a large body of these people assembled at La Chine, with the intention of carrying their threats into execution. Thomas M'Cord, Esq. one of the Police Magistrates, about four o'clock in the afternoon, left town, accompanied by the light infantry of the 49th regiment, and a detachment of the royal artillery, with two field-pieces, under the command of Major Plenderleath, and took post on a point opposite to the insurgents (consisting of about 400 persons, 87 of whom appeared to be armed) and at the distance[?] of about two acres. Mr M'Cord, with some other respectable citizens, pointed out the impropriety of their conduct, and the fate that would unfortunately await their perseverance ; urging them, by every persuasion, to disperse and return peaceably to their horses and obey the law. They replied, that they did not consider the militia bill as fully passed–that they were informed it had not received the Royal sanction ; and that although it might have passed the House of Assembly, where it originated, it had not obtained the approbation of the other branches of the Legislate ; that the law, if really enacted, had not been promagated amongst them, and that they were not properly made acquainted with it ; as such, they could not pay obedience to it. Under this false and unfortunate impression, these deluded people persisted ; but at the same time declared, with shouts of Vive le Roi that if the Government wanted their services at any time, they were ready, one and all, to come forward with their lives in the defence of their country, and that they would prove themselves, in the hour of danger, to be faithful subjects to a Government to which they were firmly attached by every principle. Finding, however, that they still persisted in their determination on this particular object, Mr M'Cord, in his Magisterial capacity, read the riot act to them and ordered them to disperse ; which not being complied with, a round shot was fired by the artillery, but elevated above injury, which was returned by the insurgents in a spirited fire with ball, deserving of a better cause. The troops then fired a volley with ball and grape, but still too much elevated to do any harm which was also returned by another discharge from the mob, upon which a few direct shots were fired at them (it being nearly dark) by the military, which made them disperse, and one man was found killed and another wounded, it is feared mortally. war;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States;military
        ID105Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18121003informUpper Canada York, July, 28. Yesterday, at an early hour, his Honour, Isaac Brock, Esq. administering the Government of Upper Canada, and Major-General, commanding his Majesty's forces therein, arrived at this place from Fort-George, and accompanied by a numerous suite proceeded to the Government Building at four p.m. when he opened the present extra session of the Legislature, and delivered the following speech to both houses :– Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislature, Council and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly, The urgency of the present crisis is the only consideration which would have induced me to call you together, at a time when public as well as private duties elsewhere demand your care and attention. But, Gentlemen, when invaded by an enemy whose avowed object is the entire conquest of this province, the voice of loyalty, as well as of interest, calls aloud to every person, in the sphere in which he is placed, to defend his country. Our militia have heard that voice and have obeyed it ; they have evinced, by the promptitude and loyalty of their conduct, that they are worthy of the King whom they serve and of the constitution which they enjoy ; and it affords me particular satisfaction, that, while I address you as Legislators, I speak to mean who, in the day of danger, will be ready to assist, not only with their counsels, but with their arms. We look, Gentlemen, to our militia, as well as to the regular forces, for our protection ; but I should be wanting to that important trust committed to my care, if I attempted to conceal (what experience, the great instructor of mankind, especially of legislators, has discovered) that amendment in our militia laws is necessary to render them efficient. It is for you to consider what further improvements they still may require. Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly, From the history and experience of our mother country, we learn, that in times of actual invasion or internal commotion the ordinary course of criminal laws has been found in adequate to secure his Majesty's Government from private treachery, as well as from open disaffection ; and that at such times its Legislature has found it expedient to enact laws restraining, for a limited period, the liberty of individuals, in many cases where it would be dangerous to expose the particulars of the charge ; and although the actual invasion of the province might justify me in the exercise of the full power reposed in me on such an emergency, yet it will be more agreeable to me to receive the sanction of the Houses. A few traitors have already joined the enemy–have been suffered to come into the country with impunity–and have been harboured and concealed in the interior ; yet the general spirit of loyalty which appears to pervade the inhabitants of this province, is such as to authorise a just expectation that their efforts to mislead and deceive will be unavailing– The disaffected, I am convinced, are few–To protect and defend the loyal inhabitants from the machinations, is an object worthy of your most serious deliberations. The speech concludes with a call for supplies. Proclamation The unprovoked declaration of war by the United States of America, against the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and its dependencies, has been followed by the actual invasion of this province in a remote frontier of the western districts, by a detachment of the United States. The officer commanding that detachment has thought proper to invite his Majesty's subjects, not merely to a quiet and unresisting submission, but insults them with a call to seek voluntarily the protection of his Government. Without condescending to repeat the illiberal epithets bestowed in this appeal of the American Commander to the people of Upper Canada, on the administration of his Majesty, every inhabitant of the province is desired to seek the confutation of such indecent slander in the review of his own particular cirumstances. Where is the Canadian subject, who can truly affirm to himself that he has been injured by the Government in his person, his property, or his liberty? Where is to be found, in any part of the world, a growth so paid in prosperity and wealth as this colony exhibits? Settled not thirty years by a band of veterans, exiled from their former possessions on account of their loyalty, not a descendant of these brave people it to be found, who, under the fostering liberality of their Sovereign, has not acquired a property and means of enjoyment, superior to what were possessed by their ancestors. This unequalled prosperity would not have been attained by the utmost liberality of the Government, or the persevering industry of the people, had not the maritime power of the mother country secured to its colonists a safe access to every market where the produce of their labour was in request. The unavoidable and immediate consequence of a separation from Great Britain, must be the loss of this inestimable advantage, and what is offered to you in exchange? To become a territory of the United States, and share with them that exclusion from the ocean which the policy of their Government enforces ; you are not even flattered with a participation of their boasted independence ; and it is but too obvious, that once exchanged from the powerful protection of the United Kingdom, you must be re-annexed to the dominion of France, from which the provinces of Canada were wrested by the arms of Great Britain at vast expence of blood and treasure, from no other motive than to relieve her ungrateful children from the oppression of a cruel neighbour ; the restitution of Canada to the empire of France, was the stipulated reward for the aid afforded to the revolted colonies, now the United States ; the debt is still due, and there can be no doubt but the pledge has been renewed as a consideration for commercial advantages, or rather for an expected relaxation in the tyranny of France over the commercial world. Are you prepared, inhabitants of Canada, to become willing subjects, or rather slaves to the despot who rules the nation of Europe with a rod of iron? If not, arise in a body, exert your energies, co-operate cordially with the King's regular forces, to repel the invader, and do not give cause to your children, when groaning under the oppression of a foreign master, to reproach you with having too easily parted with the richest inheritance of this earth–a participation in the name, character, and freedom of Britain. [The proclamation concludes with a declaration, that should the Americans refused quarter in consequence of Indians being found in Canadian ranks, that a severe and rigorous retaliation will take place.] Isaac Brock, Major-Gen. and President Head-quarters, Fort George, July 22, 1812. war;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States;military;colonial government;speeches;Native Americans
        ID106Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18121003informQuebec Papers Provincial Parliament of Lower Canada Legislative Council –Aug 1. This day at two o'clock, his Excellency the Governor in Chief went in the usual state to the Legislative Council Chamber, and being seated on the Throne, the Gentlemen Usher of the Black Rod was sent to command the presence of the Assembly, which being come up, the Honourable Speaker of the Assembly said– May it please your Excellency, His Majesty's faithful subjects, the representatives of the province of Lower Canada, have passed a bill, intituled, An Act of facilitate the Circulation of Army Bills. Their loyalty, and the happiness of this province in being connected with, and powerfully protected by the British nation, are the basis of their constitution, and the just grounds which gave rise to the formation of the militia, and the firm determination to defend this country against the unexpected and unjust war that the United States have lately declared ; they are, therefore, under the greatest obligation to your Excellency for having communicated to them your wise precautions, on the means to ameliorate and insure for several years, the punctual payment of the army, by circulating bills, the reimbursement of which is guaranteed in England. To give them greater credit, the bill limits the sums necessary, and, moreover, provides for the interest, the advantages accruing therefrom, and even for the payment of the principal in specie in this province, which has become expressly bound for the same at a fixed period, to any person whatever, who, from the state of his private affairs, would prefer such payment. In full confidence that, under the present and any unforeseen circumstance, your Excellency is invested with all necessary authority, the representatives of the province and their constituents rely on the wisdom already experienced of your administration, and in the name of the Commons of Lower Canada, I have the honour to present this bill to your Excellency, humbly requesting thereto his Majesty's assent. His Excellency was pleased to signify the Royal assent. His Excellency then addressed both Houses, and the Provincial Parliament was prorogued to the 16th of September. speeches;military;colonial government
        ID107Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18121109informExtract of a letter from Montreal Sept. 25 Our Friend Mr – arrived in town from New York a few days ago. On his way he passed three days at Plattsburgh, the head-quarters of the American army, which, from ocular observation, he states to consist of 8 or 10,000 men, under the command of General Bloomfield, Mooar, and Petit. This force is composed of 3 or 4000 regulars, about the same number of militia, and some volunteers from the southward. The militia is almost all from the state of New York, for the Yankees still refuse to march. with this force no doubt is entertained here but they will make an attack ; and if they mean to make it this season, they must be prompt in their movements, for the weather is getting cold, and they are not well clothed or appointed. Mr –, indeed, states half of them to be without shoes or stockings, which will never do for a winter campaign in this country. To repel the threatened attack, we are making every preparation in our power, and the Canadians seem well disposed to second the Government. Sir George Prevost has established a cordon, the left of which is at Chambly, and extending to Chateaguny ; the main encampment is half way between St John's and La Prairie. Colonel Murray is at St John's with a battalion ; and the Isle-auNoix is strongly fortified, with a boom and a chain secured across the river. This line of defence is composed of four regiments of the line, and 2000 drafted militia, with a corps of about 400 Canadian voltigeurs, raised last spring. The Royals, a very strong battalion, lately arrived from the West Indies, are now marching to join the camp. The citizens, both here and at Quebec, mount guard, and do garrison : indeed there are in this island (Montreal) five battalions of militia, say 3 to 4000 men, pretty well disciplined, and who on an alarm could march to this cordon in half a day.– A new regiment of embodied militia has lately been formed by drafts from the different regiments of inrolled militia in this island, and old Major Murray is appointed Lieutenant-Colonel. The gentlemen of the North-west Company army are forming a corps of their voyageurs, who will be most useful troops to act in advance with the Indians. The number originally proposed was 200, but the men have come forward so handsomely, that they are to consist of 500. Mr M'Gillivray is Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of this corps, Mr Shaw, Major, and the other partners of the Company are Captains and subalterns ; so that the men being commanded by those whom they have accustomed to obey, may be considered as already disciplined, at least in point of subordination. Sir George confines his operations to mere defence. La Motte, with about 70 Indians, advanced through the woods, about ten days ago, within hearing of this redoubtable army, and set up a war whoop, which so completely terrified them that though they could see no enemy, they lay on their arms for two two successive nights, in no expectation of an attack–to prevent which, they cut down their best bridge, and destroyed all the roads by which I suppose they mean to invade us. Mr –, who was several days at their headquarters, and who was offered the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the army, has, it is said, proposed to Sir George to destroy their camp with 500 men ; and Sir George is said to have replied, that his plan was fixed, not to make any attack nor to send a man across the line. This forebearance, which the Yankees impute to fear or weakness, tends only to increase their insolent swaggering, and their enmity is to inveterate to be allayed by any thing but hard knocks. war;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States;Native Americans
        ID108Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18131016informThe Rota frigate arrived on Monday off Plymouth, with a fleet from Halifax under convoy, and passed up the channel with the chief part of the trade. From the Hydra transport, which put into Plymouth, we have received the following official notification of Sir James Yeo's success on Lake Ontario, the American notices of which have already been published. Bulletin. Head-quarters Kingston, Aug. 14. 1813 By accounts received from his Excellency the Governor in Chief and Commander of the forces, from Commodore Sir James Yeo, dated off York, half-past one P.M. on the 11th instant, the following particulars have been transmitted of the capture and loss of the enemy's armed schooners:– On Thursday evening last, the 10th instant, the enemy's squadron, under the Command of Commodore Chauncey, got under weigh from their anchorage, off the mouth of Niagara River, and, with a fine breeze from the east, stood towards our fleet, which were becalmed off the port of Twelve Mile Creek. At sun-set, a breeze coming off the land, gave us the wind of the enemy, when our squadron stood for them, on which immediately bore away from us under as much sail as their schooners could carry to keep up with their larger vessels. The enemy's fleet formed a long. The Pike, Madison, Oneida, and six schooners (two schooners were placed to windward for the purpose of raking the masts of our squadron as it should come up). At eleven the squadron got within gun-shot of the schooners, when they opened a brisk fire, and, from their going so fast, it was more than an hour before the Wolf, our headmost ship, could pass them ; at this time the rest of the squadron was two and three miles astern of the Wolf, and on her coming up with the Madison and Pike, they put before the wind and made sail, firing their stern-chasers.– Sir J. Yeo finding it impossible to get the squadron up with the enemy, as the Wolf was the only ship which could keep up with them, then made sail between them and the two schooners to windward, which he captured, and which are called the Julia and Growler, each carrying one long 32pounder and long 12-pounder, and 40 men.– Two of the enemy's largest schooners, the Scourge, of 10, and Hamilton, of nine guns, upset on the night of the 9th, in carrying sail, and all on board perished (about 100 in number). By this loss and capture, the enemy's squadron are reduced to 10 vessels, and our's increased to eight. It is ascertained that the Pike mounts 28 long 24-pounders, and 420 men, the Madison 22 long 32 pounders, and 340 men. Boat loads of troops were taken on board the enemy's squadron on Monday last, for the purpose, it is supposed, of repelling the boarders.– The Wolf has not received any material injury, and not a person hurt. The prisoners were landed on the 11th instant, and the Growler's damage repaired. She had lost her bowsprit, and was otherwise cut up. Nothing could exceed the eagerness and enthusiasm of the officers and men in our squadron for a close engagement. war;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States;navy
        ID109Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18131007inform(From the Quebec Mercury.) Attack on Fort Schlosser. Head-quarters, Kingston, July 13. By accounts from the army under Major-General De Rottenburg, dated the 9th instant, the following particulars have been received of a bold and successful attempt to surprise the American post at Fort Schlosser. In the night of the 4th instant, a party, consisting of Volunteer Thompson and six privates of the 49th regiment, under Ensign Winder, and thirty-four of the militia, the whole under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Clarke, of the Lincoln militia, crossed over in boats from Chippawa to Fort Schlosser, which they reached a little before day-break, and completely surprised the guard, consisting of two Lieutenants, one serjeant, and eight privates, whom they made prisoners, together with three civilians and three of our own subjects, found in the Fort.– The party remained in the Fort about one hour, loading their boats form the public stores and wharf, and brought with them one brass six-pounder, 57 stand of arms, two and a half kegs of musket ball cartridges, 6 bulwarks of musket proof curtains for boats, one gun-boat, two batteaux, 20 barrels of salt, 17 casks tobacco, eight barrels of pork, and one barrel of whiskey, with a number of spades, oars, and axes ; a small party of the enemy had collected as the last boast pushed off from the shore, and several shots were fired, but the boats returned to Chippawa with their prisoners, and the articles they had captured, without a man being hurt on this service. Further accounts have also been received from the army highly creditable to the Indian warriors serving with it. On the 8th instant, a party of the King's regiment, and a body of Indian warriors were sent to endeavour to recover a considerable quantity of medicines and surgical instruments which had been buried near the Fort George when our troops retired from it. A skirmish ensued in consequence between the Indians and the enemy, in which the latter lost one officer and 20 men killed and 10 taken prisoners–the whole of the medicines and instruments were brought off by the party of the King's; the only loss sustained being three Indians wounded. Captain Norton led the Indian warriors with great spirit ; and much credit is due to Captain Merrit of the Provincial dragoons, for reconnoitering the spot where the medicines were deposited, and conducting the party to it. A few nights ago, the barracks at Gravelly Point burnt by our gun-boats, and more than 100 barrels of pork, flour, and other articles brought away from thence, together with a very fine Durham boat–500 oars colleced and partly loaded in her for Sacket's Harbour, being destroyed. Attack on Black Rock Head-quarters, Kingston, July 15 1813. G. O.–His Excellency the Commander of the forces has received a dispatch from Major General De Rottenburg, reporting a successful attack upon the enemy's post and dockyard at Black Rock at daybreak on the morning of the 11th inst. by detachments of the King's and 41st regiments, together with Liutenant Fitzgibbon's party of the 49th, and about 40 militia, the whole amounting to 240 men, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp. The enemy's position was carried by a spirited attack without the loss of a single man. Several large boats, loaded with stores and provisions, and three field pieces, a twelve and two six-pounders, were brought away ; a vessel and all the naval store-houses and barracks have been burnt. Unfortunately before the evacuation of the post was completed, a strong reinforcement of the enemy, aided by Indians, pressed this small detachment, by which Captain Saunders, of the 41st, and 15 men, were killed ; Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp, Lieutenant Montpesson, of the 41st, and 15 rank and file, wound ed. The wounded were brought over. Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp has received three wounds, severe, but not considered dangerous. By his Excellency's command, Edward Baynes, Adjutant-General British Expedition to Plattsburgh The following is an extract of a letter from a respectable citizen at Burlington, dated Aug. 1. 1813 An express arrived at Burlington on the 30th July, with intelligence that the British had left the Isle au Noix, with a force consisting of the two armed sloops, of 11 guns each, and four gallies, of one gun each, and 100 batteaux full of men, and had progressed within one mile of the town. The camp was instantly alarmed, and the troops under arms, but no enemy appeared. Next day we learnt that about 1000 troops, under the command of Colonel Murray, had landed, and took possession of Plattsburgh without opposition, there being no force to oppose them except the militia of the town and vicinity, who being only 400 in number, retreated as the enemy advanced. The arsenal belonging to the State, Pike's encampment, barracks at Serenac cantonment, and every building belonging to the United States, were immediately burnt. The enemy obtained both provisions and stores. The loss cannot be less than 50,000 dollars. The enemy left Plattsburgh on the 1st, and are understood to be proceeding this way ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? On General Dearborn invading Canada, and taking possession of Fort George, he sent off to Greenbush, as prisoners of war, the following respectable inhabitants : Messrs Edwards, Murehead, Dickson Lyminston, Lawe, two Kerrs, M'Ewan, Parson Addison, Howell, Heron, Green, Baldwin, Clinch Jones, Ball, Decoe, and John Crook. Messrs Lawe, M'Ewen and the two Kerrs were wounded on the 27th June. General Dearborn expected that the inhabitants would have joined the Americans. General Dearborn resigned the command of the Niagara army on the 23th June, on account of indisposition. General Lewis says, in his dispatch to Secretary at War, that he did not think the General would ever again be fit for service ; that the unfortunate events of the war had deranged his understanding ; and that thought sometimes in a state of convalescence, he uniformly relapsed when military topics were alluded to. General Lewis having been nominated to command at Sacket's Harbour, is succeeded at Fort George, Niagara, and on the Canadian frontier, by General Boyd. The Indian chief, Tecumseh, has seized the favourable moment of the diversion by our shipping in Virginia, for surround Fort Meigs with 2000 warriors. He had deprived the garrison of all the possibility of receiving supplies. General Clay, who commanded there, had written urgently to General Harrison for assistance. The latter was collecting his army to march to his relief. Sir James Yeo, after the retreat of the enemy's army at Fort George, swept the American side of Lake Ontario. He landed a body of troops at Great Sodus, and took the whole of the provisions, consisting of several hundred barrels of pork and flour, and burnt the buildings. The British loss was a serjeant and four privates of the Royal killed. At Genessee River, he inflicted the same loss on the enemy, taking 500 barrels of pork and 1700 bushels of corn. The provisions were delivered to General Vincent. Four companies of the Royals were embarked on board the fleet, to serve as mariners There were at Quebec, on the 22d July, 1000 American prisoners of war, captured since the commencement of the campaign. At Beaufort there were 50 officers including three General. In consequence of the conduct of the American Government and of the officers, the latter are no longer permitted to return home on parole. The Melpomene frigate, with De Meuron's regiment, from the Mediterranean, arrived in the river St. Lawrence on the 20th July. James Gready, private in the 8th, or King's regiment, and Terence Hunt, private in the 6th foot, were in the latter end of June, tried by Court Martials, for deserting to the enemy, and being found in arms, and were publicy shot at Kingston, Canada, pursuant to their sentence. It appears from the Quebec papers, and from the general orders issued by the Commander in Chief in Canada that on the late defeat of General Wilkinson on the banks of the Miami river, the American military chest, containing 15,000l. Sterling was among the property captured by the British. Captain Waugh, of the 103d regiment, died at Chamely on the 2d July. General Hampton has arrested Colonel Clark, the late commandant at Burlington, for a defalcation of about 50,000 dollars. war;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States;military;Native Americans;navy

Morrison, consisting of the 49th[?] and 89th regiments, with some companies of the Canadian militia, and a body of American troops, amounting to 4000 men, which ended in the defeat of the latter, with great loss. This action was produced by the attempt of the American General to advance to Montreal, from which it appears, however, he has now begun to measure back his steps, having crossed to the American side of the river where the action was fought, and being actively pur sued in his retreat by the British troops. The following information has been received by the Alexander, Captain Henry, which arrived at Liverpool on Tuesday:– Quebec, Nov. 26. 1813 The enemy's whole force was about 8000 men, under the command of General Wilkinson. The division commanded by General Boyd, consisting of about 3000 to 4000 infantry, cavalry &c. was alone engaged upon the 11th instant. The enemy lost in the action, Brigadier Gen. Conington and Colonel Preston, killed–probably 600 men killed, wounded, and taken. The consequence was a precipitate retreat across the St Lawrence at Cornwall on the 13th, and evacuating the province. General Wilkinson marched his troops into the Straits, the route of Plattsburgh, leaving all his boats, upwards of 300, in the Salmon river, where they were frozen in on the 16th, and 2000 men to protect them. Colonel Plenderleath came home in the Alexander, with dispatches. war;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States
        ID111Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18140319informThe following letter received in town, gives a description of the wanton and barbarous conduct of the American army, in destroying a settlement of the Moravian missionaries, in their late irruption into province:– Yesterday I received a very afflicting account from North America, by a letter from New York, dated Dec. 27 1813, concerning a report of the total destruction of our settlement, ??? ??? on the 6th of October, by the American army under General Harrison. It was the consequence of the invasion of that province, after the capture of the little fleet on Lake Erie, and the defeat of the s[?]al British force under the [?] of occupying the Chapel and some other houses for our sick British soldiers, and considering the danger the Christian Indians were in from the malice of the Americans, it was his advice, that the Missionaries and the Indian Congregation should retreat farther into the country. When the Americans were successful in the latter, it became necessary to take steps of effect it. The British behaved very kindly to the brethren, and offered to purchase the houses and cottages, but their defeat prevented it. On entering the place, the Americans first pretended to be friendly, and sorry that the Indians had fled, who had gone with Mr and Mrs Denke (one of the Missionaries) up the river. Mr and Mrs Schnall, and the aged Missionary, Michael Young, remained. During the first night the Americans already changed their tone, or rather showed their real character. They began to abuse the Missionaries with curses, and all manner of insults, plundering the houses ; and General Harrison, to whom we appealed, would grant no redress. They took every thing that was??? away ; and, under a pretence that King's stores and English goods were lodged in the houses, ransacked every place, and every trunk and chest belonging to individuals. Commodore Perry, who had defeated the Mosquito fleet on the lake, was there, and behaved rather better than the rest, advicing the Missionaries to get away as fast as they could. They did so with difficulty, and shortly after the Americans set the place on fire, and burnt down the whole, even every outhouse[?]. The poor Missionaries had a very tedious journey, and reached Silitiz, a settlement of the Brethren in Pennsylvania, December 11. Whither the Christian Indians have fled is not known ; they had proposed to go to the Grand River, about 100 miles off. war;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States;Native Americans

The proclamation declares that those who shall return to their houses and occupations before 1st December next, shall be pardoned and saved harmless from all offences, except the crime of wilful murder ; and denounces those who shall disregard this offer, as outlaws. Sydney, New South Wales, Jan. 4. The Argo has arrived with a most extensive supply of tea, viz, 167 chests of souchong, 200 ditto bobea, 200 hyson skin, and young hyson 50 ; in all 617 chests. The consequences has been a reduction in the price of souching from 30s to 5s per lb currency. Shortly prior to the Argo's departure from the Island of Mauritius, the Hope American ship, laden with tea and sundies, valued at L80,000, was captured by his Majesty's sloop Harpy, Captain Allen. In consequences of the oppressive conduct of several masters of colonial and British ships, and of their crews towards the natives of New Zealand, of Otaheite, and of the other islands in the South Pacific Ocean, which have led to the destruction of several vessels, with their crews, by the natives, and disturbed all trade and intercourse with those islands, both by British shipping and that ofthe allied powers–his Excellency has forbidden any vessel to clear out from any place in New South Wales, without a bond given by the master or owner to the naval officer for the time being at the port, for L.1000 sterling, binding him and his crew not to commit any act of hostility, or to be guilty of any trespass, or forment any animosities between the natives, or take any part in any war that may prevail ; nor forcibly carry away any male or female inhabitants of the islands under penalty of forfeiting the sum specified in the bond. A small party, who a short time ago undertook[?] a land passage in a direction towards Broken Bay, for the purpose of ascertaining the nature and fertility of the country, have discovered an excellent grazing track of 8000acres. In consequence of which one gentlemen, Mr Robert Campbell, has already sent thither an extensive herd of cattle, and this example is likely to be followed by others. Thomas West, who came to this colony a convict for life, in the ship Earl Cornwall's[?], in 1801, has received from his Excellency a conditional pardon, in consideration of his general good conduct and character for sobriety and industry, and also in consideration of his having lately erected a water mill for the grinding of grain at Barcorn Glen, within two miles of Sydney, being the first water mill ever erected in the vicinty of this town. Sydney, New South Wales, May 21. The good understanding between the natives and our settlers, which had been maintained for the last six years, has given place to frequent outrages attended with fatal consequences. On Saturday, a body of 60 natives commenced plundering the fields of a settler, when three privates of the veteran battalion fired upon them and killed a boy. The narushed upon them before they could load again, and killed on private, Isaac Eustace, and compelled the other two to fly. They then plundered the ground of Messrs Milehouse and Butcher. Next day a party of 14 soldiers falling in with them, shot a woman and two children–the savages attacked William Baker, a stock-keeper of Mr MacArthur, killed the man and two women, named Sullivan and Herburg. Sydney, New South Wales, Feb. 12.

        ID113Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18140912inform[Extracts of Letters from Quebec and Montreal.] Quebec, July 15. The commercial world is flourishing here, but in political matters, I am sorry to say, we are sadly in the back ground. The old defensive system is still adhered to, and, I fear much, with all our reinforcements, we shall do little good till we have another commander in chief. There is now a great body of regular troops in this country, and a handful of brave fellows have recently been almost sacrificed par la petite guerre at Chippawa, whilst, in the lower province, there are at least 10,000 regulars doing nothing. Some of the officers of the regiments lately arrived from France do not conceal their sentiments– On inspecting one of the regiments the other day, our chief took occasion, as usual, to make some remarks on the cut of the men's clothes, when the Colonel commanding stepped forward and told him plainly, that such systems were now completely exploded–that he had had the honour of serving very lately under a much more celebrated General that it was probable he would ever serve under again–that his men had been accustomed to fight, not to dance ; and if such was the plan he was called on to follow, he should certainly retire from the service. Such language you may suppose was not very pleasing to our Governor ; but I am happy to find that we now have military men amongst us, who are not afraid to speak out ; as it appears the numberless representations of civilians are not much attended to. Montreal, July 14. I consider this country now as perfectly secure against any attempts that the Americans may make, not withstanding the system of our chief does not seem to be changed. He has received a great many more troops this year than he had any idea of, and does not seem pleased at having so large a force unhis command, as the country will now look to him for some offensive operation against the enemy. He has done nothing the whole summer but parade about 6000 men at Chambly, where he makes them march past him twice a-week, bowing and scraping, instead of employing them where they ought to be. You will have heard of an American army of about 6000, under General Jacob Brown, having crossed the river at Fort Erie, when General Rial, with a force of 1500 only, gallantly assailed them but was overpowered by numbers, and sustained considerable loss. I inclose a general order published yesterday about this unfortunate business, whereby you will find that our loss has been great. Upon this frontier the Americans have hardly any force, and it appears very singular indeed, that so great a body of men, as are now on the other side of the river, from Sorel to Isle Aux Noix, at least 10,000 men, should be left for the purpose of parade, when they are so much wanted in the upper province. I sincerely hope that some investigation will take place into this business, as it is really disgraceful to think that such an enemy should be able to make an attack upon us with impunity. international trade;military;war;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States
        ID114Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18141015informQuebec, Sept. 10. The Americans, to the number of 900 men, landed and at tacked Fort Michillimackinac, in Lake Huron, on the 4th August. They were repulsed by the British garrison. The American fort la Prairie du Chiens has been taken by the British. This place was considered as of great importance to the enemy. Major General Conran, of the Royal, has had the misfortune to break his leg, by a fall from his horse. This officer had just arrived to join the army on the Niagara frontier, when he met with this accident. On the 31st August, the British troops broke their encampment at Odell Town, near Lake Champlain, and proceeded immediately to take possession of the position which the American army had just abandoned at the village of Champlain. This army was commanded by General Izard, and are said to have proceeded partly to Plattsburgh, and partly to Sackett's Harbour, on Lake Ontario. The British troops now at Champlain are commanded by Major Gene rals Brisbane, Power, and Robinson, and consist of the 13th, 49, 88th, Meuron's regiment, Canadian chasseurs, &c. &c. The 79th[?] or [?] Glasgow Lowland regiment are now quartered at Cornwall, in Upper Canada. The 4th[?] battalion of the 1st, or Royal Scots, are stationed at Quebec. The 3rd[?], 104th flank[?] companies, 103d, 8th, or King's, 100th, regiment de Watteville, [?] battalion of 1st, or Royal Scots, and 41st flank[?] companies are with the army under Lieutenant General Drummon, on the Niagara frontier, Upper Canada. The 37th and 57th regiments are at Montreal. On the 15th of August, the British troops under Lieutenant General Drummond assaulted Fort Erie. The attack was made in three columns, under Colonel Scott of the 103d regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Drummond 104th regiment, and Lieutenant Colonel Fischer of de Watteville's. The two former were directed to scale the fort, and the latter to get possession of a small hill, named Snake-Hill, which the Americans had fortified, and being situated only about eight hundred yards from Fort Erie, was of consequence to us. This latter column failed in their object ; but the two columns destined for the fort carried the same in a most gallant manner, and obliged the enemy to retire into two stone block-houses inside the fort, when their own guns were turned against them. At this time a most unfortunate explosion took place, which blew up the magazine and battery, and with them a number of our brave soldiers ; and the consternation caused by this was so great, and we were obliged to abandon our conquest, and retreat to our original position, with great loss of both officers and men. The large ship-building by the British at Kingston, on Lake Ontario is to be launched the second week in September– also will carry about 100 guns. The battalion of royal marines, commanded by LieutenantColonel Williams, and which has been stationed lately at Isle au Noix, and parts adjacent, have been broken up and distributed among the fleets on the Lakes. The Staff of the battalion proceed immediately to Halifax from Quebec, in the Ceylong armed-en [?] ship. The Junon frigate, Captain Upton, has arrived from Halifax at Quebec, with money for Government. The crew of this vessel is to be employed on the Lakes. A brig, which sailed from Cork, under convoy of the Antelope, of 50 guns, has arrived at Quebec.–The Antelope, and the ships under convoy, are hourly expected.

        ID115Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18141015informCanada Papers Quebec, Sept. 3. The army from this province has entered the United States by the Champlain frontier. On the 1st inst. the advance was at Chazy. Quebec, Sept. 8. From the north-western frontier of Upper Canada, Messrs M'Gillivray and M'Leod, who arrived here on Thursday last, have brought dispatches from Lieutenant Colonel M'Donal, at Michillimackinac, written since the repulse of the American forces sent there to recapture it. The following are the particulars of that expedition :– On the forenoon of the 5th of August, the Americans landed 900 men, or thereabouts, at the back of the island (Dowsman's farm). There is a considerable space of ground cleared, and a gentle slope, which enabled their vessels, at anchor close to the beach, to keep clear, by a constant fire of grape, &c. and which by the situation of the ground, passed directly over the men's heads, as they formed and advanced towards the woods. Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual[?] formed his small garrison (150 at most) at the extremity of the woods, and the Indians were stationed on each flank, to keep the enemy from outflanking the troops. By a false account of the enemy's intention to land on another part of the island, a certain number of Indians were sent to watch their motions ; but more Indians absenting themselves, exposed one flank of Lieutenant-Colonnel M'Doual's party entirely ; and an apprehension was entertained that the enemy would outflank and cut off the garrison from the forts ; it was therefore deemed expedient to fall back between the two forts, and there await the advance of the enemy. A party of between 40 and 50 Indians, placed on the left flank, and ignorant of the movements in the centre and right flank, fired on the Americans, and threw them into confusion, which the Indians soon perceived, and encouraging each other by whoops and yells, totally broke the little order still observed by the enemy, who took instant flight, and were all out of reach before Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual was apprised of their retreat. Thus was a body of at least from six to nine hundred men defeated and put to instant flight by 40 or 50 Indians, with a loss of 17 men and a Major (Holmes) killed and found on the spot!–The Indians lost but one man. Previous to and combined with this, the measures taken by the enemy were these: On the [?] of July, a detachment of the expedition sent against Michillimackinac by the enemy, proceeded to St Mary's, where they met with no resistance, there being neither troops nor Indians, and every person occupied about their usual concerns ; such as bay making, fishing &c. Major Holmes commanded the party, who gave up to indiscriminate plunder, and destroyed the whole of the property belonging to the North West Company ; burning their houses, stores, and vessels, killing their cattle, and taking off their engagees prisoners ; tearing down the fences, destroying the gardens, fields, &c. Many wanton acts of cruelty might be detailed. Let two suffice for the present. Mr Johnstone's property was plundered, even his furniture ; the very clothing of his wife and children was seized upon by these ruthless plunderers, and carried away. Major Holmes sent to the south side of the strait for Mr Johnstone's son George, and, after threatening and reviling him with the most oppobrious language, flourished his sword over his head, and said he had a great mind to cut his head off, now he was his slave, When they were in the act of burning the houses and stores, Mr G. Johnstone was ordered to stand in a certain spot, under pain of being shot ; but had he remained, sufforation[?] must have been his fate, being so near the buildings in flames : he therefore risked being shot, and came off, and thereby effected a timely escape. Another instance of more than savage cruelty was exercised on a poor horse, which they made us of all day in carting their plunder, and in the evening, whilst still tackled to the cart, tied him to the end of the dwelling-house then in flames, and amused themselves in looking at the poor animal making vain efforts to get loose ; but there he was burnt, and his bones seen there by the writer of this. war;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States;Native Americans
        ID116Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18141208informCanada Papers Montreal, Oct. 29 The express from Upper Canada, which arrived yesterday morning, confirmed the highly satisfactory reports of the preceding day, that the enemy had precipitately retreated on the 19th instant, from before Chippawa, after destroying a quantity of provisions and heavy baggage ; and that, on the 21st, they had passed over to Buffaloe a great part of their force, and were blowing up the works at Fort Erie. Further accounts from Kingston have been received this morning to the 26th instant, when the official report of the enemy's retreat from Fort Erie, after the destruction of the works, had not reached that place, but there was no doubt of the fact. Major-Genera de Watteville commanded the corps pressing on the enemy ; the master of a mail which arrived at Kingston on the 25th, in twenty-four hours from Fort George, further confirms the previous intelligence, and reports that several hundred prisoners were taken, before the Americans effected their escape across the river. On the 18th the British came up with his rear guard, and in a sharp action thirty of the Americans were left on the field wihtout a casualty happening on our side. This was at Chippawa Creek.– The enemy then fled with the utmost precipitation to Fort Erie, and began the destruction of his fortifications. A military courier from Kingston arrived this morning, brings no additional news of importance.– Sir James Yeo had returned to Kingston with the sick of the army of Niagara on board. We again sailed for the head of the Lake. A private letter from Niagara of the 10th instant, says that a severe action took place the day before near Chippawa ; our loss is stated at 10 killed and wounded. That of the enemy is supposed to be very considerable ; a field piece made to bear upon one of his columns did great execution. Another letter denies any loss in killed but makes the wounded 25 or 30. Montreal, Nov. 5. From Upper Canada we have received nothing of importance. The report of the whole American armies have crossed the Niagara was a mistake as the last accounts from that quarter mention that General Brown was still in possession of Fort Erie. Quebec, Nov. 3. We are in expectation of some further details of the operations on the Niagara frontier by this day's Montreal post ; but they had no arrived at one o'clock. The evacuation by the enemy of our territory on that frontier is a striking illustration of the importance of the command of the lake. The enemy did cross over to our side till the moment his fleet was ready to assume the superiority. The re-appearance of our fleet effected what could not be done by the expence of so much blood and treasure. (From the Quebec Gazette) The American Government has published the pa pers relating to the late negotations at Ghent. We confess that we have seen these papers with feelings of some satisfaction and much regret ; satisfaction that we can now say that the honour of the British Government is pledged to do something for British interests in North American, and regret that that something is so little. The Indians are to be made independent of both nations. This is perfectly just, and would, under certain cirumstances greatly add to the security of these provinces. The Lakes are to be exclusively British. On these subjects we must be permitted to ask how long they would be permitted to remain so, how long the Indians would retain their independence in the event of another war, if the communication with them should be in the power of the enemy ? The sole communication for military purposes, with the Indians and the Lakes, is by the river St Lawrence, from Montreal to Kingston, and from Niagara to Fort Erie ; and the Americans are to be permitted to remain in possession of one of its banks ! The enemy has hitherto been prevented from interrupting this communication by the thinness of the settlements of their side, the consequent badness of the roads, and difficulty of supplying a large force. The possession of th southern bank of the St Lawrence between Montreal and Kingson, and the power of supplying themselves, and operating on that frontier, by the roads now existing, and from Lake Champlain, has been worth a large force to them, during the whole of the war ; it has caused us to parcel our force to support the line of communication between Lake St Francis and Kingston, and keep a great proportion of it to protect the base of that line in the vicinity of Montreal. The position of Canada, relative to the United States, with its present boundaries, is an extraordinary one ; so much so, that intelligent military men have pronounced it incapable of defence much beyond Quebec. The miserable state of the enemy's preparations, the superiority which we then had on the Lakes, the good disposition of the inhabitants, and the prudent conduct of the commander of the forces, alone saved it. The waste of means in protecting and conveying supplies by a communication of five hundred miles, adjoining the whole way to the enemy's frontie, is conceivable only to those whom experience has made acquainted with the fact, or who are habituated to reflection ; and whenever the communication of the Lakes becomes interrupted, the supply of any force further advanced on the line becomes utterly impracticable. The enemy derives his supplies either by the Lakes, upon which an army can effect nothing, or from a settled country, a long way in his rear, protected by his army, a country covered with woods, and a militia more effective than the best troops in such a country, always ready for the protection of their property and their houses– Under such circumstances, the weakness of an army beyond a certain point is to be counted by its numbers. We scruple not to say, that, whenever that part of the State of New York extending to the St Lawrence, between Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain, shall be fully settled, the whole of Upper Canada must fall to the United States, the Lower Canada will not be defensible but at an expence of means far beyond its value. We had much rather see the Americans confirmed in the possession of Sackett's Harbour, Presqu-ile, Detroit and Michilimackinac, than in the possession of the tract of country just mentioned. Great Britain will always have the means of establishing a superiority on the Lakes, whenever she chuses to exert them, but she never will be able to drive the Americans out of that frontier, when once fully settled, supported as they will be by the immense population of the back parts of the State of New York and adjoining States. From the United States Papers Urbanna, Sept. 25. An express has arrived from Detroit, to General M'Arthur, in six days, in which Governor Cass says– A state of things has arrived, in which your presence, with the force at your disposal, is essential to the security and preservation of the country. The Indians have recommenced hostilities on every side of us ; they are murdering the people, and breaking up the settlements. There is now a large force of them in the immediate vicinity of this place, most probably within a mile of it, with the avowed purpose of attacking the town. We have no force adequate to the defence of the country, and none of description proper for the pursuit of the Indians– My opinion is, that you should hasten on with the mounted men with all possible expedition. The express came by water, the land communiation being entirely cut off. Albany, Oct. 25. The Legislature of this State adjourned yesterday, after a session of four weeks. The principal laws passed are: An act to authorise the raising of troops for the defence of this State. An act to encourage privateering. An act to authorise the raising of a corps of sea fencibles. An act to provide for the repayment of certain sums of money advanced by the Corporation of the city of New York, for the defence of the State, and for other purposes. An act to prevent the apprehension of British deserters. An act to authorise the raising of two regiments of men of colour. An act authorising additional pay to be made to the volunteers, and for paying the militia called into service by the State authority. An act to aid in the apprehension of deserters from the army and navy of the United States. The first act authorises the Governor to call into actual service 12,000 men, for the term of two years, provided the Government of the United States shall have declared their intention to pay, clothe and subsist them at their expence. The privateer bill authorises associations to incorporate themselves for the purpose of fitting out privateers. The following resolution, introduced by Mr Monell, passed both Houses of our Legislature unanimously on Saturday:– Resolved unanimously–That the House of Assembly of the State of New York view, with mingled emotions of surprise and indignation, the extravagant and disgraceful terms proposed by the British Commissioners at Ghent–that, however ardently they may desire the restoration of peace to their country, they can never consent to receive it at the sacrifice of national honour and dignity–that they therefore strongly recommend to the National Legislature the adoption of the vigorous and efficacious measures in the prosecution of the war, as the best means of the bringing the contest to an honourable termination, and of transmitting unimpaired to their posterity their rights, liberty, and independence. The following is a private letter which was brought by the Liffey : Montreal, Nov. 5. 1814. Sir George Prevost reached Kingston on the 10th October, where his presence has been of the utmost importance. Chauncey resigned his blockade of that place on the 8th, and retired with his squadron to Sackett's Harbour. Our fleet which was ready for the Lake in a few days after Sir George's arrival, sailed for Niagara on the 16th, with 500 of the 90th, and a supply of provisions and stores for the right division, and arrived off Fort George on the evening of the 18th. Having landed this reinforce ment, Sir James returned to Kingston on the 24th. The enemy at Fort Erie having been joined by General Izard's army, making a force of 7 or 8000 men, advanced upon General Drummond, and attacked our positions upon the Chippawa on the 15th instant ; but having met with an opposition unexpected by them, and making no impression, retired on the 16th and 17th to Black Creek, from whence they advanced one of Izard's brigades, 1500 men, on the 19th, with a view of our turning our right, and attempted to cross the Chippawa, about six miles from its mouth, where they were met with by a corps of about 1000 troops, under Colonel Meyers, who faced them most manfully ; they skirmished the whole day, in which the Glengarries supported their high character, and, in the evening, Jonathan finding himself foiled, and unable to bring up his artillery from the horrid state of the roads, retired again to the main body at Black Creek. Our casualties on this occasion were triflin– those of the enemy were said to have been considerable, though he refrained from exposing himself to our fire in the open ground. We had two field-pieces there, and whenever the enemy showed a column out of the wood, a well-directed discharge soon obliged them to return to their shelter. By this time our fleet being announced, gave alarm to the enemy, and they commenced a precipitate retreat to Fort Erie. They were purused on the 20th and 21st by our advance, under Major-General Watteville, close to Fort Erie, where he found them occupying the high ground, which General Drummond had not left many weeks before, and could push no further. At the date of the last accounts from General Drummond, Jonathan still maintained his post, from which it will require a few columns of fresh troops to dislodge him, but as they are now on their way to join the right dividion, I trust I shall in a short time have the pleasure to acquaint you of the complete expulsion of the enemy from the Niagara frontier. It is said, that for want of sufficient shelter, a part of General Izard's force had crossed to Buffalo, and that they had passed over some heavy artillery and stores, leaving at the fort such a force as they conceived capable of defending it. Sir James brough down with him the skeleton of the 1st battalion of the King's regiment, and the remains of the two flank companies of the 10th. He sailed again on the 1st inst. taking with him about 1200 men, comprising the 37th, a brigade of artillery, a 9pounder, and detachments from the 6th and 82d regiments, and a large supply of provisions and stores. The five hundred of the 9th regiment who marched to York would be crossed to Niagara in the brigs ; the 9th, 850 strong, were to have been embarked in the fleet, but Sir James could not take them. The Royals, 41st, 89th, and 100th, exhausted corps, return to Kingston by this trip of the fleet, which I fear was scarcely able to make another this season. The St Lawrence has proved a noble ship, and one and all seem delighted with her. The frigate in frame arrived at Kingston, where she has been laid down and lengthened to make her the size of the Prince Regent. The keel of a 74 is also laid down there. The Americans are said to have commenced upon two more ships of the class of the Superior. Letters from Michilimacinack to the 19th October state, that the capture of the two schooners will be attended with the most important benefits in the security of that post, and the territory dependent upon it. Captain Rocheblave, with the detachment of the 81st under Capt. Wardrop, and artillery, arrived there on the 14th October, without any casualty among the troops ; and Mr M'Kenzie, with his brigade, would arrive about the 21st. The two schooners had made a trip to Nottawasage for provisions and supplies, and would attempt another before the navigation closed. A reinforcement had been sent under Capt Bulgar to Praire du Chain. The arrangements necessary for reinforcing and supplying General Drummond's army being completed, and the attack upon Sackett's Harbour being deemed impracticable this season, Sir George returned last evening to this place ; his journey to Kingston has certainly had the effect of inducing General Brown, with a considerable part of his force, to move to Sackett's Harbour, and has thus left General Izard so much weakened at Fort Erie, that I have little doubt of the result of an attack upon him. I am sorry to see that the malice of a certain party here has been at work at your side of the water ; it has increased tenfold since the expression of the public sentiment in favour of his Excellency, by the addresses which are now preparing, and which I can assure you is the real and unsolicited voice of the people. I am happy to find that General Kempt is going to England, as he will afford true information upon the state of the country, and be able to exposethe falsehoods which have been circulated respecting recent events. war;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States;Native Americans;military;privateering
        ID117Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18160115informNew South Wales A journey into the interior of New South Wales, across the Blue Mountains, performed by his Excellency Colonel Mac quarrie, Governor of the settlement. From the official account, dated Sydney, June 10. 1815. The Governor desires to communicate, for the information of the public, the result of his late tour over the Western or Blue Mountains, undertaken for the purpose of being enabled personally to appreciate the importance of the track of country lying westward of them, which had been explored in the latter end of the year 1813, and beginning of 1814, by Mr George William Evans, Deputy Surveyor of Lands. To those who know how very limited a track of country has been hitherto occupied by the colonists of New South Walves, extending along the eastern coast to the north and south of Port Jackson only 80 miles, and westward about 40 miles, to the foot of that chain of mountains in the interior which forms its western boundary, it must be a subject of astonishment and regret, that amongst so large a population no one appeared, within the first twenty-five years of the establishment of this settlement, possessed of sufficient energy of mind to induce him fully to explore a passage over these mountains ; but when it is considered that for the greater part of that time even this circumscribed portion of country afforded sufficient produce for the wants of the people, whilst on the other hand, the whole surface of the country beyond those limits was a thick, and in many places, nearly an impenetrable forest, the surprise at the want of effort to surmount such difficulties must abate very considerably. The records of the colony only afford two instances of any bold attempt having been made to discover the country to the westward of the Blue Mountains. The first was by Mr Bass, and the other by Mr Caley, and both ended in disappointment; a cirumstance which will not be much wondered at by those who have lately crossed these mountains. To Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth, Esqrs. and Liutenant Lawson, of the Royal veteran company, the merit is due of having, with extraordinary patience and much fatigu, effected the first passage over the most rugged and difficult part of the Blue Mountains. The Governor being strongly impressed with the importance of the object, had, early after his arrival in this colony, formed the resolution of encouraging the attempt to find a passage to the western country, and willingly availed himself of the facilities which the discoveries of these three gentlemen afforded him. Accordingly, on the 20th of November 1813, he entrusted the accomplishment of this object to Mr George William Evans, deputy surveyor of lands, the result of whose journey was laid before the public, through the medium of the Sydney Gazette, on the 12th of February, 1814. The favourable account given by Mr Evans of the country he had explored, induced the Governor to cause a road to be constructed for the passage and conveyance of cattle and provisions to the interior ; and men of good character, from amongst a number of convicts who had volunteered their services, were selected to perform this arduous work, on condition of being fed and clothed during the continuance of their labour, and being granted emancipations as their final reward on the completion of the work. The direction and superintendence of this great work was entrusted to William Cox. Esq. the chief magistrate at Windsor ; and to the astonishment of every one who knows what was to be encountered, and sees what has been done, he effected its completion in six months from the time of its commencement, happily without the loss of a man, or any serious accident. The Governor is at a loss to appreciate fully the services rendered by Mr Cox to this colony, in the execution of this arduous work, which promises to be of the greatest public utility, by opening a new source of wealth to the industrious and enterprising. When it is considered that Mr Cox voluntarily relinquished the comforts of his own house, and the society of his numerous family, and exposed himself to much personal fatigue, with only such temporary covering as the bark hut could afford from the inclemency of the season, it is difficult to express the sentiments of approbation to which such privations and services are entitled. Mr Cox having reported the road as completed on the 21st of January, the Governor, accompanied by Mrs Macquarrie, and that gentleman, commenced his tour on the 25th of April last, over the Blue Mountains, and was joined by Sir John Jamieson, at the Nepean, who accompanied him during the entire tour. The following gentlemen composed the Governor's suite: Mr Campbell, Secretary ; Captain Antill, Major of Brigade ; Lieutenant Watts, Aide decamp ; Mr Redfern, Assistant-Surgeon ; Mr Oxley, Surveyor-General ; Mr Mehan, Deputy Surveyor-General ; Mr Lewin, Painter and Naturalist ; and Mr G. Evans, Deputy Surveyor of lands, who had been sent forward for the purpose of making further discoveries, and rejoined the party on the day of arrival at Bathurst Plains. The commencement of the ascent from Emu Plains to the first depot, and thence to a resting place, now called Spring Wood, distant twelve miles from Emu Ford, was through a very handsome open forests of lofty trees, and much more practicable and easy than was expected. The facility of the ascent for this distance excited surprise, and is certainly not well calculated to give the traveller a just idea of the difficulties he has afterwards to encounter. At a further disstance of four miles a sudden change is perceived in the appearance of the timber and the quality of the soil, the former becoming stunted, and the latter barren and rocky. At this place, the fatigues of the journey may be said to commence. Here the country became altogether mountainous, and extremely rugged. Near to the 18th mile (it is to be observed that the measure commences at Emu Ford), a pile of stones attracted attention. It is close to the line of road, on the top of a rugged and abrupt ascent, and is supposed to have been placed there by Mr Caley, as the extreme limit of his tour. Hence the Governor gave that part of the mountain the name as Caley's[?] Repulse. To have penetrated even so far was at that time an effort of no small difficulty. From henceforward to the 26th mile is a succession of steep and rugged hills, some of which are almost so abrupt as to deny a passage altogether ; but at this place a considerable extensive plain is arrived at, which constitutes the summit of the western mountains ; and from thence a most extensive and beautiful prospect presents itself on all sides to the eye. The town of Windsor, the river Hawkesbury, Prospect Hill, and other objects within that part of the colony now inhabited, of equal interest, are distinctly seen from hence. The majestic grandeur of the situation, combined with the various objects to be seen from this place, induced the Governor to give it the appellation of the King's Table Land. On the south-west side of the King's Table Land the mountain terminates in abrupt precipices of immense depth, at the bottom of which is seen a glen, as romantically beautiful as can be imagined, bounded on the further side by mountains of great magnitude, terminating equally abruptly as the others, and the whole thickly covered with wood. The length of this picturesque and remarkable track of country is about 24 miles, to which the Governor gave the name of the Prince Regent's Glen. Proceeding hence to the thirty-third mile, on the top of a hill, an opening presents itself on the south-west side of the Prince Regent's Glen, from whence a view is obtained particularly beautiful and grand–mountains rising beyond mountains, with stupendous masses of rock in the fore ground, here strike the eye with admiration and astonishment. The circular form in which the whole is so wonderfully disposed induced the Governor to give the name of Pitt's Amphitheatre (in honour of the Right Hon. William Pitt) to this offset of branch from the Prince Regent's Glen. The road continues from hence for the space of 17 miles on the ridge of the mountain which forms one side of the Prince Regent's Glen, and there it suddenly terminates in nearly a perpendicular precipice of 676 feet high, as ascertained by measurement. The road constructed by Mr Cox down this rugged and tremendous descent, through all its windings, is no less than three-fourths of a mile in length, and has been executed with such skill and stability as reflects much credit on him. The labour here undergone, and the difficulties surmounted, can only be appreciated by those who view this scene. In order to perpetuate the memory of Mr Cox's services, the Governor deemed it a tribute justly due to him to give his name to this grand and extraordinary pass, and he accordingly called it Cox's Pass. Having descended into a valley at the bottom of this pass, the retrospective view of the overhanging mountain is magnificently grand. Although the present pass is the only practicable point yet discovered for descending by, yet the mountain is much higher than those on either side of it, from whence it is distinguished at a considerable distance, when approaching it from the interior, and in this point of view it has the appearance of a very high distinct hill, although it is in fact only the abrupt termination of a ridge. The Governor gave the name of Mount York to this termination of the ridge, in honour of his Royal Highness the Duke of York. On descending Cox' Pass, the Governor was much gratified by the appearance of good pasture land and soil fit for cultivation, which was the first he had met with since the commencement of his tour. The valley at the base of Mount York he called the Vale of Clwyd, in consequence of the strong resemblance it bore to the vale of that name in North Wales. The grass in this vale is of a good quality, and very [?]dant, and a rivulet of fine water runs along it from the eastward, which unites itself at the western extremity of the vale with another rivulet containing still more water. The junction of these two streams forms a very handsome river, now called by the Governor, Cox's River, which takes its course, as has been since ascertained through the Prince Regent's Glen, and empties itself into the river Nepean ; and it is conjectured, from the nature of the country through which it passes, that it mut be one of the principal causes of the floods which have been occasionally felt on the low banks of the river Hawkesbury, into which the Nepean discharges itself. The Vale of Clwyd, from the base of Mount York, extends six miles in a westerly direction, and has its termination at Cox's River. Westward of this river the country again becomes hilly, but it is generally open forest land, and very good passage. Three miles to the westward of the Vale of Clwyd, Messrs Blaxland, Wentworth, and Lawson, had formerly terminated their excursion ; and when the various difficulties are considered which they had to contend with, especially until they had effected the descent from Mount York, to which place they were obliged to pass through a thick brush-wood, where they were under the necessity of cutting a passage for their baggage horses, the severity of which labour had seriously affected their healths, their patient endurance of such fatigue cannot fail to excite much surprise and admiration. In commemoration of their merits, three beautiful high hills, joining each other at the end of their tour at this place, have receieved their names in the following order, viz. Mount Blaxland, Wentworth's Sugar Loaf, and Lawson's Sugar Load. A range of very lofty hills and narrow vallies alternately form the track of country from Cox's River, for a distance of 16 miles, until the Fish River is arrived at ; and the stage between these rivers is consequently very severe and oppressive on the cattle. To this range the Governor gave the name of Clarence Hilly Range. Proceeding from the Fish River, and at a short distance from it, a very singular and beautiful mountain attracts the attentions, its summit being crowned with a large and very extraordinary looking rock, nearly circular in form, which gives the whole very much the appearance of a hill fort, such as are frequent in India. To this lofty hill Mr Evans, who was the first European discoverer, gave the name of Mount Evans. Passing on from hence the country continues hilly, but affords good pasturage, gradually improving to Sidmouth Valley, which is distant from the pass of the Fish RIver eight miles. The land here is level, and the first met with unencumbered with timber. It is not of very considerable extent, but abounds with a great variety of herbs and plants, such as would probably highly interest and gratify the scientific botanist. The beautiful little valley runs northwest and south-east, between hills of easy ascent, thinly covered with timber. Leaving Sidmouth Valley, the country becomes again hilly, and in other respects resembles very much the country to the eastward of the valley for some miles. Having reached Campbell River, distant 13 miles from Sidmouth Valley, the Governor was highly gratified by the appearance of the country, which there began to exhibity an open and extensive view of gently rising grounds and fertile plains. Judging from the height of the banks, and its general width, the Campbell River must be on some occasions of very considerable magnitude ; but the extraordinary drought which has apparently prevailed on the western side of the mountains, equally as throughout this colony for the last three years, has reduced this river so much, that it may be more properly called a chain of pools than a running stream at the present time. In the reaches or pools of the Campbell River, the very curious animal called the Paradox, or Water Mole, is seen in great numbers. The soil on both banks is uncommonly rich, and the grass is consequently luxuriant. Two miles to the southward of the line of road which crosses the Campbell River, there is a very fine rich track of low lands, which has been named Mitchell Plains. Flax was found here growing in considerable quanities. The Fish River, which forms a junction with the Campbell River a few miles to the northward of the road and bridge over the latter, has also two very fertile plains on its banks, the one called O'Connel Plains, and the other Macquarrie Plains, both of considerable extent, and very capable of yielding all the necessities of life. At the distance of seven miles from the bridge over the Campbell River, Bathurst Plains open to the view, presenting a rich track of champaign country of 11 miles in length, bounded on both sides by gently rising and very beautiful hills, thinly wooded. The Macquarrie River, which is constituted by the junction of the Fish and Campbell River, takes a winding course through the Plains, which can be easily traced from the high lands ajoining, by the particular verdure of the trees on its banks, which are likewise the only trees throughout the extent of the plains. The level and clean surface of these plains gives them at first view very much the appearance of lands in a state of cultivation. It is impossible to behold this grand scene without a feeling of admiration and surprise, whilst the silence and solitude which reign in a space of such extent and beauty as seems designed by Nature for the occupancy and comfort of man created a degree of melancholy in the mind which may be more easily imagined than described. The Governor and suite arrived at these Plains on Thursday the 4th of May, and encamped on the southern or left bank of the Macquarrie River–the situation being selected in consequence of its commanding a beautiful and extensive prospect for many miles in every direction around it. At this place the Governor remained for a week, which time he occupied in making excursions in different directions through the adjoining country, on both sides the river. On Sunday, the 7th of May, the Governor fixed on a site suitable for the erection of a town at some future period, to which he gave the name of Bathurst, in honour of the present Secretary of State for the Colonies. The situation of Bathurst is elevated sufficiently beyond the reach of any floods which may occur, and is at the same time so near to the river on its south bank as to derive all the advantages of its clear and beautiful stream. The mechanics and settlers of whatever description who may be hereafter permitted to form permanent residences to themselves at this place will have the highly important advantages of a rich and fertile soil, with a beautiful river flowing through it, for all the uses of man. The Governor mut however add, that the hopes which were once so sanguinely entertained of this river becoming navigable to the Western Sea have ended in disappointment. During the week that the Governor remained at Bathurst he made daily excursions in various directions ; one of these extended 22 miles in a south-west direction, and on that occasion, as well as on all the others, he found the country chiefly composed of vallies and plains, separated occasionally by ranges of low hills; the soil throughout being generally fertile, and well circumstanced for the purpose of agriculture or grazing. The Governor here feels much pleasure in being enabled to communicate to the public that the favourable reports which he had received of the country to the west of the Blue Mountains have not been by any means exaggerated. The difficulties which present themselves in the journey from hence are certainly great and inevitable, but thsoe persons who may be inclined to become permanent settlers there will probably content themselves withvisiting this part of the colony but rarely, and of course will have them seldom to encounter. Plenty of water, and a sufficiency of grass are to be found in the mountains for the support of such cattle as may be sent over them ; and the tracks of fertile soil and rich pasturage which the new country affords are fully extensive enough for any increase of population and stock which can possibly take place for many years. Within a distance of ten miles from the site of Bathurst there is not less than 50,000 acres of land clear of timber, and fully one half of that may be considered excellent soil, well calculated for cultivation. It is a matter of regrets that in proportion as the soil improves the timber degenerates ; and it is to be remarked, that everywhere to the westward of the mountains it is much inferior both in size and quality to that within the present colony ; there is, however, a sufficiency of timber of tolerable quality within the district around Bathurst for the purposes of house-building and husbandry. The Governor has here to lament that neither coals nor limestone have been yet discovered in the western country ; articles in themselves of so much importance, that the want of them must be severely felt whenever that country shall be settled. Having enumerated the principal and most important features of this new country, the Governor has now to notice some of its live productions. All around Bathurst abounds in a variety of game ; and the two principal rivers contain a great quantity of fish, but all of one denomination, resembling the perch in appearance, and of a delicate and fine flavour, not unlike that of a rock cod. This fish grows to a large size, and is very voracious. Several of them were caught during the Governor's stay at Bathurst, and at the halting place on the Fish River. One of those caught weight 17 lb ; and the people stationed at Bathurst stated that they had caught some weighing 25 lb. The field game are the kangaroos, emus, black swans, wild geese, wild turkies, bustards, ducks of various kinds, quail, bronze, and other pigeons, &c. &c. The water mole, or paradox, also abounds in all the rivers and ponds. The site designed for the towns of Bathurst, by observation taken at the Flag Staff, which was erected on the day of Bathurst receiving that name, is situated in latitude 33. 24. 30. south, being also 27 1/2 miles north of Government House, In Sydney, and 94 1/2 west of it, bearing west 20. 30. north, 83 geographic miles, or 95 1/2 statute miles ; the measured road distance from Sydney to Bathurst being 140 English miles. The road constructed by Mr Cox, and the party under him, commences at Emu Ford, on the left bank of the river Nepean, and is thence carried 101 1/2 miles to the flag staff at Bathurst. This road has been carefully measured, and each mile regularly marked on the trees growing on the left side of the road proceeding towards Bathurst. The Governor in his tour made the following stages, in which he was principally regulated by the consideration of having good pasturage for the cattle, and plenty of water :– 1st stage–Spring Wood, distant from Emu Ford 12 miles 2d stage ditto–Jamieson's Valley, or 2d depot, distant from ditto . . . . . . . . . . 28 3d ditto–Blackheath, distant from ditto . . . 41 4th ditto–Cox's River, distant from ditto . . .56 5th ditto–The Fish River, distant from ditto . 72 6th ditto–Sidmouth Valley, distant from ditto . 80 7th ditto–Campbell River, distant from ditto . 91 8th ditto–Bathurst distant from ditto . . . 101 1/2 At all of which places the traveller may assure himself of good grass, and water in abundance. On Thursday, the 11th of May, the Governor and suite set out from Bathurst on their return, and arrived at Sidney on Friday the 19th Ult. The Governor deems it expedient here to notify to the public, that he does not mean to make any grants of land to the westward of the Blue Mountains, until he shall receive the commands of his Majesty's Ministers on that subject, and in reply to the report he is now about to make them upon it. In the mean time, such gentlemen or other respectable free persons as may wish to visit this new country will be permitted to do so, on making a written application to the Governor to that effect, who will order them to be furnished with written passes. It is at the same time strictly ordered and directed that no person, whether civil or military, shall attempt to travel over the Blue Mountains without having previously applied for and obtained permission, in the above prescribed form. The military guard stationed at the first depot on the mountains will receive full instructions to prevent the progress of any persons who shall not have obtained regular passes. The necessity for the establishing and strictly enforcing this regulation is too obvious to every one who will reflect on it to require any explanation here. The Governor cannot conclude this account of his tour, without offering his best ackowledgements to William Cox, Esq. for the important services he has rendered to the colony in so short a period of time, by opening a passage to the new discovered country, and at the same time assuring him that he shall have great pleasure in recommending his meritorious services on this occasion to the favourable consideration of his Majesty's Ministers. settlement description;agriculture

        ID119Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18161121informCanada Papers. Montreal, Oct. 5. On the afternoon of Saturday last, the specie seized on board the Lake Champlain steam-boat, amounting to upward of 12,000 dollars, arrived at his Majesty's cash-office here, under the escort of the 19th light dragoons from St John's. At length we have authentic accounts relating to the expedition of Lord Selkirk ; they are very important, as many ex parte details have been published - his taking Fort William by storm, making all the partners of the North West Company prisoners, &c. ; but the cause of the expe dition has never been explained. The Canadian Courant puts it in a very clear point of view:– Mr Robert Semple, the Governor-General The Hudson's Bay Company on the Red River, towards the close of the year 1815, took possession of two establishments belonging to the North West Company, which had obtruded themselves on the territory of the Hudson's Bay Company. The North West traders then altered their route, going into the Upper Country by circuitous ways, by which much delay took place ; and in order to try Mr Semple, they sent two cartloads of provisions by the former track in June last, with a guard of fifty men ; the advance, twenty-two of the number, fell in with one of the natives, whom they took forward with them to prevent discovery. The rear-guard passed within four miles of the settlement ; they were perceived by the Governor, and were attacked by a party from the garrison, consisting of about thirty soldiers ; an engagement took place, stated on the 19th of June. Mr Semple and 21 of his men were killed ; the rest of his forces returned defeated to the fort ; it is on this account that the expedition of Lord Selkirk was undertaken. The manner of Lord Selkirk's conducting the expedition we do not justify, nor indeed can we form any opinion on the subject without further authentic details ; it is, however, but justice to say, that the Hudson's Bay Company have rights, and are a chartered Company ; the North West Traders, though we believe a most respectable body, are only an Association of Merchants. currency;military;rebellion
        ID121Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18170721entertainEmigration to America. [ Extracted from No.15 of Cobbet's Register, published on Saturday, 12th instant ]. Cobbett's arrival in America,&c. On Wednesday evening, the 27th March, we embarked on board the Importer, D. Ogden, master, bound to New York, where we arrived on the 5th of May, with about 40 steerage passengers, farmers, and tradesmen, who were fleeing from ruin and starvation. In all respects that can be named our passage disagreeable, and upon one occasion very perilous, from lightning, which struck the ship twice, shivered two of the masts, killed a man, struck several people slightly, between two of whom I was sitting, without at all feeling the blow. Some of our fellow-passengers have found great disappointment ; and, it is stated in some of the public papers here, that many hundreds have, during the last year, accepted of the offer of our Consul at New York to go and settle in Canada. You know that I have never advised any body to emigrate. I have always said that it is no place for manufacturers ; no place for men to live without work ; no place for a farmer who does not work himself ; no place in short, for any one who is not able and willing to work at the ordinary sorts of work ; but for such men there is every where a plentiful, happy, and easy life. None should come, however, who have any views of idleness ; and even for the industrious poor, I see no reason why they should expend their last shilling, and undergo all the miseries and dangers of a sea voyage, in order to save those who eat the taxes the expence of their share of poor-rates ; a man and his wife and a child or two cannot come under the expence of 35 guineas, at least. A single man 20 guineas, before he gets into work again ; and, as I always said, I never would, if I were in the place of such a man, expend my earnings on a sea voyage, and endure all its hardships, in order to remove one eye sore out of the way of corruption. Besides, there is the climate, which is not so good as ours, though it is not bad, and people often live to an old age. The country is good, but it will easily be conceived, that new face, an entire new scene, a separation from every friend, work done in a quite different way from it is in England ; it will easily be conceived, that all this makes such a dislocation in a man's mind as to make him very unhappy for a while. Then, he cannot expect to find work the first day. He must ask first, at any rate. Englishmen are sheepish ; and, they are sure to find rascals enough here to foster their disgust, merely for the sake of serving the cause of corruption at home. In short, I advice nobody to emigrate, but I will truly describe the country and the people. As to emigrating with a view of settling and farming in the new countries, it is neither more nor less than downright madness. It is what our English farmers know nothing at all about ; it is what they are not at all fit for ; and the far greater part of all such spe culations end in disappointment, if not in ruin and premature death. I hope that our beloved country will shortly be fit for an honest and industrious man to live in ; but if any farmers come with money in their pockets, my advice is, not to give way either to enthusiastic admiration, or to instant disgust. But, to stop a little ; to look about them ; to see not only after good land, but a good market for its products. The western romance writers tell us, that the land in the Ohio is too good ; but Mr Mellish, in his valuable book, tells us, that beef and pork sell for three halfpence a pound. An excellent country for people who want to do nothing but eat. – Give me Long Island, where the land is not too good ; but where beef and pork sell for about eightpence a pound (I speak of English money); where good hay sells for five pounts a ton ; and where there is a ready market for every species of produce. One thing above all ; if an English farmer (I mean by English, people of the whole of the United Kingdom) comes here, with money in his pocket, let him resolve to keep it there for a year, and then he will be sure to do well. – All that I see around me here is well calculated to attract the attention and to please the sight of one, like myself, brought up in the country, always greatly delighted with, and somewhat skilled in, various pleasing and healthful pursuits. The The people are engaged busily in planting their Indian corn. The cherry trees, of which there are multitudes, planted in long avenues or rows, or round the fields, have dropped their blossom and begin to show their loads of fruit. The apple and pear orchards, in extent from one to twenty acres on each farm, are in full and beautiful bloom. The farms are small in extent ; no appearance of want amongst the labourers, who receive, in the country, about two shillings and threepence (our money) a-day, with board and lodging, and which board consists of plenty of excellent meat and fish of all sorts, the best of bread, butter, cheese, and eggs. That you may form some idea as to prices of living, I will state a few facts, which have already come within my own knowledge. We are at present at an inn, thirteen miles from New York. It is on the road to that city. Scarcely an hour in the day passes without a carriage of some sort offering for going thither, and to go by the regular stage costs three shillings. Mind, I shall always speak in English money, when I do not speak of dollars. We lodge and board in this inn, have each a bed-room and good bed, have a room to sit in ourselves ; we eat by ourselves ; and it really is eating. – We have smoked fish, chops, butter, and eggs, for breakfast, with bread (the very finest I ever sa), crackers, sweet cakes ; and when I say that we have such and such things, I do not mean that we get them for show, or just enough to smell to ; but in loads. Not an egg, but a dish full of eggs. Not a snip of meat or of fish ; but a plateful. Lump sugar for our tea and coffee ; not broke into little bits the size of a hazle nut, but in good thumping pieces. For dinner, we have the finest of fish, bass, mackerel, lobsters ; of meat, lamb, veal, ham &c. ; asparagus in plenty ; apple pieces (through in the middle of May). The supper is like the breakfast, with preserved peaches and other things. And with all this an excellent cyder to drink, with the kindest and most obliging treatment, on the part of the landlord and landlady, and their sons and daughters, we pay no more than 22s. 6d. a week each. In England the same food and drink and lodging at an inn would cost us nearly the same sum every day. But there are two things which no money can purchase any where. The first is, no grumbling on the part of the landlady, except on account of our eating and drinking too little ; and the other is, that Mr Wiggins has no fastening but a bit of chip run in over the latch of the door, to a house which is full of valuable things of all sorts, and about which we leave all our things much more carelessly than we should do in our own house in any part of England. Here, then are we able to live at an inn, one of the most respectable in the whole country, at the rate of fifty pounds a year, while the pay of a common farming man is not much short of that sum. emigration and immigration;weather;agriculture;prices;economic migration
        ID122Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18180101informEmigration The authenticity of the following details of the miseries endured by some German emigrants proceeding from Amsterdam to America is, we are told, guaranteed ; otherwise they are almost too shocking to admit to belief : Libson, Nov. 4 We have just been witnesses here of an event which has renewed those gloomy reflexions which the friends of humanity have indulged ever since the commencement of the emigration from Germany and Switzerland to America. We have deplored the error which led so great a number of unhappy persons to expartiate themselves in the hope of finding a happier lot upon the shores of the new world. But it is less to the blindness of the victims of this error, than to the abominable speculations of cupidity that we are to attribute these numerous emigrations. the misery of the people of Germany and Switzerland, occasioned by a superabundance of population, and by the bad harvests of late years, serves for aliment to the avarice of certain men, who seek to establish criminal projects upon bases almost as obnoxious as those of the former slave trade. Such calculations deserve the attention of Governments, and it is with this view that we think is our duty to make known the fate of an expedition of this kind, fitted out at Amsterdam last August. But we shall first transcribe, from the original, the article of the charter party relative to the power reserved by the Captain over the persons of the passengers, as inlcuding stipulations which are most characteristic of the nature of that odious traffic :– We passengers, promise to fulfil faithfully the following conditions:– With respect to the price of the passage above stipulated, for so much as we have not yet paid, we engage to gain by our labour in America, what we owe, and we who owe the whole amount of our passage are bound, if required, and if we are unable to find better conditions, to hire ourselves for four or five years, in order to pay for our passage ; and we who have only paid for a part of our passage, equally promise to let ourselves out to work for the same time for the sum we still owe. We promise besides, we passengers, men or women, fathers or mothers, children and families here assembled, the children for their parents, the parents for their children, the brother for his brother, and the sister for her sister, when we shall find an opportunity to employ ourselves in America, to engage ourselves in service, and to answer for one for the other one for all the others, whether he be of our family or not, so that the price of the passage be diminished or augmented as much as shall be necessary, until we all and our families have employment, and the captain be no loser by us ; knowing very well that we passengers who have children, a family, brothers, and sisters, ought all to sumbit to our wives or husbands, our children, our brothers, our sisters, being sent separately to whatever place, in order to gain, in private service, profession, or labour, or in any manner that shall be deemed best, the price of our passage ; and in order that we may not in any case refused the engagements proposed to us, or contract others without the permission not knowledge of the capain, it is agreed for those who have not yet paid for their passage, for those who still owe part, and for those who cannot find an engagement, that they must consent to me, the captain, carrying them to such place in America as it shall please me, and wherever I may find it expedient to proceed, or wherever it may suit me to sail. These horrible conditions were signed by 300 passengers. They had contracted with the Captain of a Dutch ship, which was to proceed first to Baltimore. She in the worst state when she sailed from Amsterdam, and in defiance of the clauses of the contract, by which the Captain had engaged to feed them properly during the voyage, he had not even embarked the necessary quanitity of provisions ; for, after 62 days navigation, the leaks had so gained upon the ship, that she was in danger of sinking, and famine had already made frightful ravages. It was at the end of that time, and in this deplo rable condition, that she was forced into Belem, near Lisbon. Long before her arrival on our coasts, the passengers had been reduced to the greatest misery, not more by the small quantity than by the bad quality of the provisions. The water was gone, and sea-water was their only drink. So much had they been wasted, that forty had already died of famine. Among the rest there were a great many sick, some of who have died since their arrival in Portugal. The situation of the vessel had at first given great alarm to our Council of Health, who, apprehensive of contagion, were for an instant fearful that it would be necessary to force her out to sea. That would have been a misery so much the more formidable, because the ship was not in a state to keep the sea, and all must infallibly have perished. Happily this was deemed unnecessary, and a quarantine was ordered. The Regency of Lisbon determined that provisions and other succours should be furnished at the expence of the State. All the Consuls were most active and benevolent in affording assistance. Such was the result of the expedition. Many others have, no doubt, answered as little the expectations of those who, seduced by deceitful promises have emigrated to America in search of happiness which they could not find, abandoning their country, their parents, and their friends. In July, a Hamburgh ship, with 106 Swiss passengers, was at Lisbon, in nearly the same distress with the Dutch ship. It is said here that there is a company in Holland which has numerous agents to seduce men to emigrate. It heaps them pell mell on board ships, and if they reach their destination, they are soon con vinced of the fallacy of all their hopes. It would be a desirable thing for papers, in countries where these emigrations are excited, to insert the article relative to the charter party, given above, in order that the simple and credulous may see what they have to undergo. emigration and immigration;agriculture;newspapers;economic migration
        ID123Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18180119informExtract of a letter from the agent to at the Cape of Good Hope, dated 15th Nov. 1817: – The following most daring instance of piracy was committed in our harbour on the 11th inst. viz.– The Elizabeth, White, lying at anchor off Robin Island, with about 120 tons of oil on board, was boarded at about one a. m. by a party of armed deserters from his Majesty's 10th regiment, and convicts, about 12 in number, i. e. five soldiers and seven convicts, who, after securing the hatches, &c. obtained possession of the ship, and in the same instant cut the cables, loosed the sails, and favoured by a strong S. E. wind, succeeded in carrying her off, at six a.m. The captain and crew having refused to listen to their invitation to join them in their piratical undertaking, with the exception of the mate, were permitted to leave the ship in the boat, which reached Robin Island in safety about four o'clock the same day. By a letter received to-day we learn that the Admiral Gambier, Brash, laden with Government stores for Ceylon, was totally lost on the morning of the 20th of June last, having struck on the reef Roan de Nova, in the Mozambique Channel ; crew saved. A letter from Halifax, dated the 27th Nonember, says – Colonel Bouchette, Surveyor - General of Lower Canada, with Captain Campbell, of the 60th regiment, and Mr Bouchette, jun. arrived here on the 19th inst. The only information I can yet give you is, that the exploring survey has been extended from the source of the St Croix river to the river Restigouche, in line about 100 miles ; in this short distance both parties experienced difficulties and sufferings of the severest nature. The Americans employed on the same line with our English Commissioners are represented as men of great ability, and acting with that spirit of liberality that infuses confidence on each side, rendering their arduous task less severe and gloomy than was to have been expected in thie untrodden wilds of this quarter. Our trade continues dull, and money scarce. Government bills are 3 per cent advance, but expected to be lower, in consequence of the Commissary-General having refused to take the provincial notes. Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard –On Friday night, about half-past nine o'clock, this place was thrown into the greatest consternation, by the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard, the beating of drums, and the firing of the men of war's guns. It was occasioned by a fire having broken out in the house belonging to the steam engine erected for carrying on the new works situated in the southern part of the dock - yard, near the kilns used for burning cement stone. The most serious apprehensions were entertained for the safety of the arsenal ; and what was more distressing to the feelings of the spectators, was its coniguity to the workhouse, which, from the pressure of the times and want of employment, is crowded with many unfortunate individuals. Providence, however, averted the impending danger, and about twelve o'clock we had the pleasure of seeing the raging flames subdued, with only the loss of the engine-house. No lives, it is understood, have been lost, but one poor man is severely hurt. Captain Walker of the Northumberland, and the officers of that ship, Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter, and Captain Brown and the officers of the Ordinary, with the military officers and soldiers of the garrison, assembled on the first alarm. The latter were under arms the whole time, and were of great service in keeping off the spectators. The inhabitants of the twon were at one time under serious apprehensions, as the fire was not far from the Fountain tavern, and the residence of Mr Miller, in High Street. At the former, the landlady of the house had but recently lain in, and was removed on the first alarm being given. Sir Robert Barlow, from Chatham, who superintends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle, was here yesterday to investiage into the cause, which it is suspected arose from carlessness – The damage, however, has not been so great as was at first expected, and which it might have been but for the prompt and effectual assistance that was given – Sheerness, January 11 international trade;meeting;transportation;shipwreck;currency;colonial government;fire

        ID125Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18180119informIrish Emigrants. New York, Nov. 27. Nothing scarcely can be conceived more distressing than the situation of an unfriended stranger arrived here, from across the Atlantic, without the means of helping himself, and without even enough of acquaintance with the men and things about him to enable him to judge what path he should take to secure him the miseries of absolute want. Such, however, is actually the situation of hundres who annually land on our shores. To provide for those forlorn beings, several attempts have been made by associations of humane individuals here, but nothing hitherto has appeared to promising as that of which an account here follows: – At a meeting of Irishmen, and descendents of Irishmen, held at Harmony Hall, on Tuesday the 25th instant, for the purpose of promoting a Settlement of Irish Emigrants; Andrew Morris, Chairman, WM. Sampson, Secretary ; Upon the motion of Thomas Addis Emmett, the circular previously issues on this subject was read by the Secretary : – Circular It is a sentiment long felt, and often expressed, that something should be undertaken on behald of the emigrants who flock to these shores. Without any fixed destination, they remain in the sea port, until beocming victims of bad counsel and bad example, they lose the pure and honest energies with which they left their native land, and suffer worse than shipwreck in their moral qualities. The Government of this great Republic is well aware of the advantage to be derived from so great a mass of laborious industry, when usefully directed and employed–and of adding to the nation's strength, men whose attachment to the institutions of this country is assured by so many ties. But it is in the order of things, that some of the friends, particularly the countrymen of these emigrants, who have been some time established and known, should come forward to attest the necessity, and guarantee the solidity of the enterprise. If his has not been done sooner, it is because every advance in social improvement must come in its season. it is the ripeness of the occasion, and the voice of the times that now speak. It has been remarked that among the lands nows open for sale and settlement, there are some tracks, particularly in the Illionois territory, where the Irish emigrant, with the instruments to which his hands are accustomed, and in a climate congenial to his habits, might procure to himself immediate shelter and subsistence–and, in a few years, be able to repay with gratitude the benefits conferred on him. We, whose names are undersigned, have met to consult upon the means of promoting some establishment that might be a rallying point for the distressed, and give to the wanderer a habitation and a home. We have thought of no better way than to address, by this circular, the friends and well wishers of Ireland, who co-operation might give most weight to the measure, and to submit, whether it might not be advisable to join all our efforts, and petition Congress early in the ensuing session, for a grant of a suitable track, upon a credit of 14 or 15 years, subject to such conditions and modifications as the Government may see most fitting. to the Government we would offer no deceptive, delusive, or precarious motive, rather chusing to make its wisdom, benignity, and patriotism, the anchor of our hope. We request of our, if you approve of our sentiment and of our project, to advance and promote it by your best endeavours ; either by forming organized associations, or by obtaining individual signatures, to a petition to the effect stated. We have not yet been able to digest a plan, and have rather chosen to make this humble beginning, in hopes that we should soon receive additional light upon the subject from cor respondence we solicit. We shall, nevertheless, proceed to investigate the subject, and challenge the co-operation of good and respectable men, and request of you to do the same. You will please address your answers, and any future correspondence, to Mr James Moffit, No. 15. Frankfort Street New York. Thomas Addit Emmet. Denis M'Carthy, William Sampson, John R. Skiddy, James R. Mullaney, John Meyher, William James M'Neven, Cornelius Heeny, Matthew Carroll, Robert Swanton, James Moffit. New York, Nov 18, 1817 Mr Emmet then stated, that he had been requested by the gentlemen who called this meeting, to explain the objects for which it was convenued ; that it could not be necessary to expatiate before those he was now addressin, on the situation of the peasantry and farmers in Ireland ; it was at present one of unqualified misetry, partly occasioned by their local oppressions, and partly by the general calamities of Europe ; it compelled them to fly to these shores in such numbers, and under the pressure of so great poverty, that the most active individual benevolevence could neither provide them with a sufficient present succour, nor procure for them, within a reasonable time, the means of permanent settlement. The consequence was, that many of those unfortunate strangers were totally lost to this county, or forced by want to become noxious and dangerous to its cities, whose original dispositions and qualifications, if rightly directed and employed, would have made them valuable and useful members of the community. Besides, the accounts transmitted back to Ireland of their disappointments and destitute situations, deferred many who were suffering at home the extreme of wretchedness, from endeavouring to better their condition in this more fortunate and favoured land–to the political institutions of which they were also more strongly attached. A very painful reflection on these circumstances had suggested to come gentlemen then present the hope that the general Government might be induced, by a strong and united application, to grant a portion of its unsettled lands on terms liberal and bountiful, so that an asylum might be formed for industrious and enterprising farmers, who would gladly fly from famine and persecution to a spot where the sweat of their brows falling on a fertile soil would yield them a rich harvest, for their own exclusive benefit, and where they might peacefully enjoy all the blessings of that republication liberty they loved. The time for making such an application seemed auspicious ; party asperities had softened fown, and probably few would now be led by political prejudices to give it opposition. Neither was it unprecedented ; a favour nearly similar had been granted to the French emigrants, and to settlers from Switzerland. It is true we could not forth a pretence like the cultivation of the vine or the olive ; and we would not succeed by practising any delusion. We could offer nothing but an immediate accession of industrious and hardy settlers, who in a congenial soil and climate would become enthusiastically attached to the country and the Government from whence they derived all their blessings, and, wherever they were found, would form a barrier against every enemy. Much might undoubtedly be expected from the generous sympathy which the sorrows and sufferings of Ireland had everywhere excited in the United States, and from the acknowledged liberality of its Constituted Authorities ; but very forcible arguments might also be addressed to its policy and interest. Not only those that in the ordinary course of events would arrive here, whose usefulness is lost by the want of proper direction, and who become burdens or scourges to our cities, would be rescued and placed in a situation where all the energies of active and enterprising minds would be serviceable to themselves and the community ; but also the very fact that such an asylum was open and accessible, would infinitely increase the amount of emigration from Ireland, and people our wildernesses with incalculable rapidity. The place upon which we have fixed our eyes is in the Illinois territory–it has been lately purchased, and is not yet even surveyed. In the ordinary course of events, it is not likely to be brought into market (at least to any extent) for many years ; but if Congress listen to our application, and grant to the settlers an extended credit, Government will receive payment for the land probably as soon as if it were suffered to remain unheeded till its regular turn for sale came round. A large body of settlers will be enabled to grow rich during the time that the land would otherwise be waste and unproductive, and the value of all the contiguous property belonging to the United States would be rapidly and immensely increased, to say nothing of the advantages resulting from the strength of such a settled frontier. All these considerations may be strongly urged by men, who can most truly say they are actuated by no views of personal speculation or emolument ; who are willing to enter into all the labour of procuring settlers and organising the establishment, without any prospect of gain, or even compensation, except as to what may be necessary for defraying the expences of the undertaking ; and who are desirous that the actual settlers should enjoy all the advantages which Government may be willing to grant. These are our views–we conceive that they may be realized, if supported by an united and active co-operation of those who think like us in other parts of the Union. We are, therefore, desirous of adopting and pointing out to others what seems to be the best mode of giving system to that co-operation ; namely, the formation of societies totally divested of all party or political feelings, and directing the attention only to this object. There are already a sufficient number of political institutions in every State, in which the zealous partizan (be his opinions what they may) can act on them to their fullest extent. Let these societies be neutral groun, or rather consecrated places, in which, when we meet, we lay aside all our hostilities, and join as brothers in our prayers and offerings at the shrine of our common worship. They are consecrated to every man amongst us, by the purity of their object, by our earliest recollections, by our unbroken affection, and our strongest sympathies– by the unextinguished love of our native land, for which most of us have already renounced all sectarian antipathies and religious animosities ; which we offer as a solemn pledge to the country of our adoption, that our hearts will be always alive, from temperament as well as prin ciple, to the emotions of patriotism ; and that those amongst us who have pledged their faith to her, however they may seem to differ on some minor political subjects, will always be found firmly ranged and united under the same banners, and forming one phalanx whenever her more important interests are concerned. Mr Emmet then moved four resolutions, which being severally put, were carried with some slight amendments as follow :– 1. Resolved–That it is expedient to form a Society of Irishmen and descendents of Irishmen, for the purpose of endeavouring to procure from Congress a track of land in the Illinois territory, to be settled by emigrants from Ireland. 2. Resolved–That every person of the foregoing description, who shall, on or before the second day of December next, pay to the Secretary of this Meeting the sum of five dollars, shall be entitled to become a Member of the said Society, until the number of subscribers shall have amounted to one hundred, after which time the subscribers shall be at liberty to elect their own officers and no person shall afterwards be admitted except by ballot. 3. Resolved–That it be recommended in Irishmen, and the descendents of Irishmen, in the other cities and towns of the Union, to form similar societies for the purpose of corresponding and co-operating with that which is about to be formed in this city. 4. Resolved–That, as the meeting of Congress will shortly take place, and in order to prevent the less of time, a Committee of fifteen be appointed to prepare the outlines of a memorial to that body, to be submitted to the consideration of the Society, when formed and organized ; and also to adopt such measures as they may think expedient for promoting and accelebrating the organization of that Society. Mr John W. Mulligan, in seconding Mr Emmet's motion, expressed, in handsome terms, how much he was gratified by the invitation to attend, had given him the opportunity of claiming his title of descendent of an Irishman. A Committee was then appointed, pursuant to the fourth resolution, the number being, upon motion and discussion, augmented to twentyone. Committee –Andrew Morris, Thomas Addis Emmet, William Sampson, John W. Mulligan, Thomas Kirk, James Moffit, Robert Swanton, Matthew Carroll, William James M'Neven, Captain Skiddy, Dennic M'Carthy, John Meyher, James M'Bride, Cornelius Heeney, William Paterson, Colonel Mulaney, David Bryson, Captain O'Sullivan, James J. M'Donnell, Dennis H. Doyle, James Hayes. A subscription paper being then opened, a number of those present subscribed their names and paid five dollars as their initiation fee, and became members of the association. Those persons who wish to become original members may do so by signing their names and paying their subscription to the Secretary before 2d December, pursuant to the second resolution. After the meeting was adjourned, the Committee organized itself, and appointed Sub-Committees, to report a draft of a constitution and a memorial to Congress, and for the discharge of other requisite duties. meeting;emigration and immigration;national characteristics;charity;economic migration
        ID127Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18180716informCanada Papers from Upper Canada contain the draft of a petition to the Prince Regent, founded on the resolutions adopted in the province of Niagara, where some discontent has been manifested. The first part is as follows:– To his Royal Highness George Prince of Wales, Regent of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, &c. the humble Address of the Inhabitants of Upper Canada May it please your Royal Highness, The subjects of your Royal Father, dwelling in Upper Canada, should need no words to give assurance of their loyalty, if the whole truth had reached the throne of their Sovereign. His subjects have reason to believe that the truth has not been told. During three years of war, Upper Canada was exposed to the ravages of a powerful and inveterate foe. The Government of the United States had been long concerting the invasion of this province. Hostile preparations against it had been long masked under other designs ; and at last the accumulated torrent of violence burst on the defencless children of the British empire. Nor were they assailed by the weapons of war alone ; an invidious proclamation preceded those host of the enemy, forgetful of honour, regardless of humanity, and daring to seduce the subjects of Britain from their true allegiance. The subjects of Britain remained dauntless and firm. It was not for their property that they rose against their invaders ; the invader would have spared to them their property. They flew to arms in defence of the rights and sovereignty of Britain. Twice has the American standard been planted in Upper Canada, while yet but a handful of British troops aided the native battalions wave the laurel of victory over the protrate intruders on their soil. The second year of war saw Canada contending with yet little assistance from the parent state. The second year of the war saw her sons confirmed in their virtue, and still more determined to resist. Wives and children had fled from their homes ; the face of the country was laid waste, and the fire of revenge was sent forth to consummate distress and misery ; still was the spirit of the people unextinguished, still did it burn with patriotism and loyalty. By the third year every risk of conquest was at an end, for now the British aid poured into the provinces, and peace was proclaimed when war was no longer to be feared. It is now more than three years since there was an end of war, but, strange to say, these years of peace have manifested no appearance of affection or care from the mother country to the Canadas. Commercial treaties have been made, altogether neglectful of British interests here. Government transactions, which used to give spirit to trade and are at a stand; troops are withdrawn ; fortifications are suffered to go to ruin ; and rumours are abroad too shocking to be repeated in the Royal ear. May it please your Royal Highness to listen calmly to the complains and grievances of the people of Upper Canada who are fully assured that your Royal Highness has been kept ignorant of most important truths ; who are well assured of the generous disposition of your Royal heart, and of your desire that British subjects should every where share equally you paternal regard an affection. It was a matter of much provocation to the people of the province to see, even during the war, which afforded such striking proofs of their loyalty and valour, reports went home highly rating the merits of regular troops, while the tribute due to Canadian levies were unfairly set down, may, the principles of the most loyal subjects here were often stigmatised by British officers, ignorant of human character, and still more so of circumstances which affect it in this part of the world. It was not so with the immortal Brock. He justly appreciated Canadian worth, and his memory will happily long cherish, in the minds of the Canadian people, a due regard for the genuine spirit of a British solider, at once generous and brave. The loyal inhabitants of Upper Canada would disdain to notice the misrepresentations of individuals, so contrary to notorious truth, if these had not obviously conspired with other causes to lessen the regard which should subsist between British subjects here and at home, to influence the conduct of Ministers towards the general interests of the province. The loyal subjects of his Majesty in Upper Canada suffered grievously during the war in their property, and many were bereft of their all. A solemn investigation on this subject took place ; the claims of the sufferers were authenticated, and there was every reason to expect that recompence would immediately follow ; yet nothing has followed but delay and insult. Surely if there is among mankind a single principle of justice, that is one, that the individuals of a nation ought not, partially, to bear the weight of public calamity. Surely individuals who have exposed their lives for Government should not be disgusted with finding Government regardless of those very principles which it is intended to sustain. The people of this province are well aware that their fellow subjects at home are pressed hard with taxations, and far it is from their wish that relief should be afford from thence. Canada contains within itself ample means of exonerating Government from the claims of sufferers by war ; and it is within the fiat[?] of your Royal Highness to remove, by a signle breath, the evil now justly complained of. Millions of acres of fertile lands lie here at the disposal of your Royal Highness, upon the credit of which, under proper management, not only the fair claims of loyal sufferers could be instantly advanced, but vast sums could be raised for the improvement of the provinces, and the increase of revenue to Britain. Another grievance, manifesting the neglect of Government to the concerns of Upper Canada, is equally notorious, and must be still more abhorrent to the general feelings of your Royal Highness. The young men of this province, who were armed in its defence had, for their spirited conduct, the promise of their commanders, that land would be granted them as a reward for their services, as soon as war was terminated ; and after this promise was universaly confided in the Parliament of Upper Canada passed an extraordinary law, in the face of established British principles, that militia should pass beyond the frontier. With these promises, and in obedience to this law, the militia passed beyond the frontier with alacrity ; yet since the peace, the greater part of them had been denied the pledge of their extraordinary services, and the land is unjudtly withheld. The petition further states that such ingratitude, such dishonour, such errors in policy, could not exist without extraordinary influences, and it recommends most important changes equally for the glory of the throne, and benefit of the subject. It says that the scandalous abuses came some years ago to such a pitch of monstrous ingratitude, the the home Ministers wisely imposed restriction on the Land Council of Upper Canada. It seems, however, that all this was insufficient, and that confusion on confusion has grown out of this unhappy system. Upper Canada, it is now said, pines in comparative decay, and that discontent and poverty are experienced in a land supremely blessed with the gifts of nature. It is insisted that the immediate interference of his Royal Highness might do much to remove the evils which spring from the system of patronage and favouritism, and it asserts that the interposition of the British Parliament is more imperiously required. It concludes as follows:– Deeply penetrated with these sentiments, and most seriously inclined to have changes speedily effected, the loyal subjects of Great Britain dwelling in Upper Canada now take the extraordinary step of sending home Commissioners to bear this to the throne, and humbly intreat your Royal Highness to give ear to the details which it will be in their power to relate: above all, that your Royal Highness would immediately send out to this province a commission, consisting of discreet and wise men, men of business and talent, who shall be above every influence here, and who may be instructed to make inquiry into all the sources of evil. war;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States;military;colonial government

If these accounts should prove true, I think the President will as good reason for recommending to Congress, at the next session, the abolition of the army, as he had at the last, for doing away the naval forces on the lakes– because it was more likely to involve us in war, than to give us security and peace. A little while ago we made quite a bluster and noise because the King of Spain had imprisoned one of our citizens at Cadiz; but the nation seems to rest very easy at present with the above named executions. Why?–because the wrong is committed by us, not against us. Extract of a letter, dated Washington city, June 2. 1818:– The British Consul-General, A. St. John Baker, is about to depart for Europe; the ostensible cause of his departure is the recovery of his health, but it is sufficient to look in his face to see that it is only a common diplomatic disease, which may be aggravated or cured at discretion ; the real object is diplomatic ; the English Cabinet has expressed some hesitation in regard to certain subjects in Mr Bagot's dispatches ; the speculation carrying on between the Spanish agents and some persons in this place opens a field of corruption so wide and comprehensive. Mr Baker goes prepared to state the facts, from his immediate knowledge ; for no man is better acquainted with men and things here.– The Chevalier Colonel Sarmiento is also preparing to visit Madrid, but his business appears to relate to mercantile affairs of some Americans on the west coast ; he received 27,000 dollars for one service of this king, but the object for which he received the douceur failed, and he will not refund. Treasury Department. Washington, May 25, 1818. SIR–The act of Congress, concerning navigation, hereto annexed, which is to take effect the first day of October next, so materially changes the commerce of the United States with the colonies and territories of Britannic Majesty, thata due regard to the convenience and interest of those engaged in it requires that the construction of the act should at this time be determined. According to the term used un ther the first section of the act, every port or place in the British colonies and territories in the West Indies, and on the continent of America, must be considered as closed against vessels of the United States, to which they are not by act of Parliament permitted to carry on the same trade, both in exports and imports, which is now, or shall be, carried on in British vessels between the ports of the United States and the ports of any British colony or territory. The permissions by act of Parliament to vessels of the United States to go in ballast to Turk's Island, and bring away salt, or to carry certain articles to one or more of the Bahama Islands, and bring away salt, and a few other articles, cannot be considered as opening the ports of those islands to the vessels of the United States, according to the intention of the act of Congress, whilst British vessels are permitted to carry on the same trade in articles prohibited to vessels of the United States. It may be proper to observe, that the prohibition in the first section applies equally to vessels whether in ballast or with cargoes. The form of the bond required by the second section of the act is hereunto annexed. It is expected that proper circumspection will be exercised in requiring a security, as much of the efficacy of the act will depend upon the judicious discharge of this part of your duty. I am, very respectfully, Sir, your most obedient servant, Wm. H. Crawford. Collector of the Port of Alexandria, D.C. From the Philadelphia Gazette. Extract of a Letter, dated Laguira, May 11. General Morillo has obtained a victory at Coxeder, eleven leagues from St Carlos, over Paez, who had under his command about 1500 cavalry, and 600 or 800 infantry, out of which 1000 men were killed, and 400 horses and three stand of colours taken. The Spaniards lost 100 in killed and wounded. This took place on the 2d instant. Extract of a letter, dated from St Thomas, 26th May. We have the official news here from Caraccas, that another battle had been fought on the 11th instant, about 20 leagues west from San Carlos, in which both parties seem to have fought with desperation. The Spaniards say that the Patriots are totally defeated, but acknowledge the loss of many first rate officers. The Commander in Chief of the Royal army engaged (De La Torre) is severely wounded, and his Aid-deCamp (Colonel Villars), and about 20 officers killed and wounded.

That whilst this Convention holds it one one of the most sacred right of British subjects at all times directly to petition the throne of their Sovereign relative to their grievances, yet nevertheless, under the present peculiar existing circumstances of this country, the Members of this Convention, as well out of respect to that Honourable Body the Commons House of Assembly of Upper Canada, as for other causes, deem it their indispensable duty, on this important occasion, to recommend in the strongest terms to their fellow subjects resident in this province, a spirit, formal, and respectful application to that Honourable House, for an inquiry into the state of the province. 2. That John Clarke Cyrus Sumner, and Roderick Drake, Esqs. be a permanent Committee, for the management of the affairs of the Convention, and that they, as soon as may be practicable, prepare a respectful petition, praying for inquiring, and expressive of grievances (for the sanction of this Convention), to be by them circulated for subscribers, and presented at the bar of the House of Assembly at their next meeting session. That the said Committee be further authorised to frame and Address to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent, on the subject of grievances believed to exist in Upper Canada, which, when approved of by the Convention, shall be submitted by the Committee, together with the petition above mentioned, to the Honourable House of Assembly, at their next meeting, for their alterationg and amendment. Mr Gourlay, who has had so instrumental a hand in instigating these proceedings, is stated to have been arrested and held to bail, at Kingston, for distributing a printed account of the state of grievances of the people of the Niagara district ; and this by direction of the AttorneyGeneral of the province, who is reported to have influenced the Justice who signed the warrant, by certain threats of vengeance if he refused. Another report is mentioned as being in circulation, namely, that official instruction have been sent to particular Magistrates, to take notice of, and transmit to Government, the names of all persons holding commissions, civil or military, who engage in the measures of petitioning the Prince Regent, as recommended by Mr Gourlay, in order that they may be removed from their offices. The Upper Canada Convention met at York on the 6th inst. under the Presidency of Richard Bearly, Esq. J. P. It has styled itself a Convention of Friends to Free Inquiry, and resolved to change the proposed plan of sending deputies to England with a petition to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent, confining itself to an application to the House of Assembly for an inquiry into the state of the province, and a petition to his Royal Highness, to be presented to Sir Peregrine Maitland for transmission.– From the Quebec Gazette of July 31. meeting;colonial government;crime
        ID130Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18181228persuadeOur paper of Thursday last contained a general view of some of the most popular publications on the subject of emigration, and we shall now endeavour briefly to make an estimate of the good and evil which is likely to befall those who embark in this hazardous adventure. There is one important fact which we gather from all the accounts of America, whether written for the purpose of praise or censure, namely, that there is a great demand for labour, and that wages are high, and this effect is necessarily produced y the vast space of fertile and unoccupied territory which lies westward of the United States towards the Pacific Ocean. It is this vacant territory which is the true spring of this American community. Here is the grand outlet for the superflouous population both of the eastern states of America and of Europe. To cultivate this waste there is a constant demand for new labourers ; wages are, of course, high – the labourer lives in comfort, and, if he is industrious, he becomes in his turn a purchaser of land from the savings which he accumulates. If labour should become more plentiful, and wages should fall, this is the signal for new emigrations ; and thus, this constant demand for labour in the western districts regulates its general price throughout the United States. In these circumstrances it is clear that a labourer, provided he can reach this advantageous market for his labour, will unquestionably improve his condition. But herein lies the difficulty. A labourer has seldom the means of of subsistence so far beforehand as to enable him to undertake so long a journey ; and, if he enters upon the enterprise with insufficient means, he is liable to starve before he can transport himself to his ultimate destination, or he is forced to contract, for immediate subsistence, obligations little short of servitude, under the weight of which he is grievously oppressed. These, then form strong objections to emigrations in the case of those who are stinted to their means ; but where these objections can be surmounted, those who can transport their labour from the overstocked market of Europe to the understocked market of America, will unquestionably dispose of it to better advantage ; but if they have not the means, they may as furely fail in the attempt, and draw upon themselves aggravated misery and want. As to the consequences of emigration to this country, we hold them rather to be beneficial than otherwise, and we cannot easily account for the very absurd alarm which has been propagated on this subject. The evil in Europe is, that every country is overcrowded with labourers, who cannot find employment ; and is it not manifest, therefore, that the withdrawing of some of these will make more room for the labourers that remain – that the loss of those useless hands will rather be a relief to the body politic, and will diffuse greater soundness and vigour through all its parts? That these effects will follow from emigration in this or in any other country in Europe we cannot doubt – and that the labourer, if he can afford the expence of the journey, will receive higher wages in America than in this country, is equally clear. There is another class of adventurers who may possibly improve their circumstances by emigration, although this is not so certain, namely, farmers with a moderate capital. An allotment of land may be purchased in the back parts of America at the Government price of two dollars per acre, and an emigrant who can afford to but and to cultivate 100 or 200 acres, and acts with proper judgement and skill, may undoubtedly, by a speculation of this sort, be sure of a subsistence, while, by the continued emigrations from the eastern states, the country being quickly settled all around him, his property is daily improving in value. But a want of judgement in the purchase, or a want of ability to cultivate the land after it is purchased, may involve him in irrecoverable distress and ruin ; and to avoid these hazards no little discrimination and prudence is necessary. Such are some of the most striking advantages of emigration, and we shall now state some of its disadvantages. The first, and chief of these, is the difficulty of effecting a settlement, and of subsisting until the land which is purchased yields its first produce. The country is partly open ground, or prairie, as it is called, or it is covered with almost boundless forests. A settlement in the woods requires incredible labour to clear it – labour is dear, and not easily procured, and this herculean task naturally devolves on the head of the family, who is forced during the day to ply the axe in this laborious drudgery of felling trees, and afterwards to follow the chace for a meal to his family. Here he must frequently sleep out in the woods ; and his body, exhausted with his day's labour, is exposed to the cold dews of night ; under such unintermitted toil his health declines, and it is obvious that his family, deprived even for a single day of his exertions, must be reduced to the most deplorable straits. In many parts the country which is marked out for emigrants is extremely unhealthy, in particular the banks of all the navigable rivers, which afford the most eligible settlements both in point of fertility and situation, are exposed to the most fatal maladies. The same causes which produce fertility produce disease. The overflowing of the waters, from the autumnal and spring floods, fertilise the land in a most wonderful degree ; but the exhalations of these stagnant waters, under a burning sun, are as fatal to the health as the deposits which they leave are favourable to the soil. Hence the many minute directions which are given to all emigrants in regard to their health. In a letter contained in the Emigrant's Guide, we have the following advice to those who are descending the Ohio : If the weather becomes warm, guard well against the smell of bilge water. But if you must descend in the spring, go early – avoid all delay, and remember you are fleeing for your lives. I have seen the havoc, and I believed it not till then. Again it is observed, Let nothing tempt you to fish in warm weather, immediately on changing your climate. The effluvia of the shores is poison. To a European emigran the climate must be, of course, even more fatal ; and he either therefore lose his health, or he must be continually tormented with anxiously taking care of it, which makes it a question whether it is worth having on such terms. Such are the hardships through which, if he has strength to endure them, he at length emerges into ease and independence. These hardships, however, will no doubt be in a great measure avoided, or at least mitigated, if he has beforehand provided the means of subsistence until he can derive regular supplies from his own land. In this case he is less liable to be dislodged from his situation by the casualties to which all emigrants are necessarily exposed. – He is secured against the hardships of a first settlement, and is more certain of attaining the wished for object of ease and affluence – To a farmer, therefore, or a labourer, emigration presents a fair chance of a permanent settlement, provided it is gone about with ordinary caution, and the necessary degree of energy be exerted to insure success. But it is a gross delusion to imagine that an elysium is to be found in the United States, or that mankind exist there on any more favourable terms than in this country, and those who set out on any such visionary schemes are sure to meet with a woeful disappointment. With regard to other classes of society, it does not appear that they will improve their condition by emigration to America ; there is no demand for clerks or professional men of any sort, and no merchant has any thing to expect by removing his capital to the United States. In the back settlements there is a demand for schoolmasters to teach the ordinary branches of education, and several emigrants of this class have met with good encouragement. In regard to the essential article of comfort, it is apparent, from all the best information on the subject, that a person long resident in this country would change for the worse by an emigration to the United States. He would, in the first place, suffer extremely from the climate, from the extreme cold of winter and the raging heat of summer, the thermometer frequently standing at 98 degrees in the share, with a clear sky and broiling sun, and very little abatement of this exsessive heat being experienced through the night. His frame, accustomed to the more temperate, though unsettled climate of this country, runs the risk of being debilitated by the change, and at all events he must suffer extremely in his enjoyments and in his spirit from this cause. Nor, we should imagine, would the manners of the people in the back parts be found very agreeable or polished. It is admitted on all hands, both by those who are favourable and those who are unfavourable to the Americans, that if there is not, as in Europe, gross ignorance and debasement on the one hand, neither is there on the other any thing much exalted above the ordinary level. But the inferences which arise from this established fact are strongly in favour of Europe. The grossness of vice and ignorance carries a sure antidote to its corruptions in the disgust which it excites : such examples are not so potent to debase, as examples of a different sort are to purify and exalt. There is little risk that society will be contaminated by what is low and debased ; but on the other hand, there is a certainty that what is exalted and illustrious in literature, science, taste, accomplishments, or fashion, will exercise a powerful influence on the general state of manners. We naturally copy what we admire, and those great and shining examples constitute a standard to which the whole system of life and manners has a tacit reference. In the United States they have no such models – they do not aim at so high a standard, and taste and manners are therefore necessarily at a lower ebb than in Europe – Hence all accounts agree in reprobating the extreme filthy habits which universally prevail ; and Cobbett, who will be suspected of too great partiality to this country, draws a contrast between the inhabitants of Hampshire and those of the United States, in which he places this vice of the American manners in strong colours ; and he adds, as his reason for this, that they have no gentlemen's seats, with the fine improvements of pleasure grounds, &c. dispersed through the country, as models of taste and neatness for the inferior classes, and it is to the same principles that we may trace other defects in their manners, namely, that they have no proper models on which to form themselves. Hence, excepting in the principal cities, we may safely conclude, from all the information we have received on the subject, that society has not reach the same degree of refinement as in this country. An emigrant accustomed to live in Britain would also feel the disavantages of American society strong in this, that here, in so closely peopled a community, surrounded with all sorts of refinements, life is assisted by such a variety of helps, that it glides down the smooth stream of comfort and convenience, without ever meeting with a single interruption. It is astonishing to what a pitch of improvement a society is brough, abounding in wealth and in all the mechanical arts, and where the ingenuity of thousands is incessantly on the rack to set on foot new devices for the common good. We are not duly sensible of the advantages of this, because, like other advantages, they are familiar to us by long habit, and we begin to imagine that they are inherent in the natural constitution of things. But when we are suddenly transplanted into a new community, abounding indeed in subsistence, but deficient in all comforts – where only the coarsest mechanic arts are practised – where the inhabitants are so widely dispersed, that their common exertions cannot be made available for the common good, we find life interrupted at every turn. In our former society, if we had not the previous secret of transmuting all things into gold, we had at least the power of transmuting gold into every thing else. But here the power of money is limited. We must indeed pay for services, but we must also beg for them ; and thus we go on fretting and tormenting ourselves under petty incommodities, which in this country would be remedied as soon as they were felt. It is incon ceivable how much inconvenience and discomfort and real unhappiness may spring from this cause. In this country, by long habit and pracrice and continual improvement, every thing has fallen into its right place – each individual has a separate task assigned him in the joint task of labouring for the general benefit – and the industry of all, however variously directed, tends to one common end. There is a perfect unity of effort. We all labour in common – we combine our efforts that they may yield the largest possible produce, and this produce is accurately shared among the various members of the community, each receiving the share to which his labour entitles him. Such is substantially the process by which commerce diffuses the benefits of industry over every civilized community. – Money is the instrument by which this division is effected. Every one who labours has the value of his labour ascertained in money, which is a draft upon the common stock for whatever quantity of necessaries and luxuries he is entitled to ; and all these complicated operations are executed with a regularity almost mechanical. But in a community newly forming there is a want of unity and combination – all the members labour indeed, but no one has his proper part assigned him – there is a jostling and an interference with each other – and when they come to divide, some have too much, and some too little, of certain articles – the stock is ill assorted, and money will not execute its functions. Hence disorder arises, and inconvience and awkward wants, and an individual suddenly removed into this region of discomfort from the happier climate of a highly improved community, must be annoyed with feeling in the highest degree gloomy and disagreeable. He must have the same sensation as a person who quits an elegant mansion, fitted up with every comfort and convenience, for one of inferior quality and coarsely finished, where he is exposed to a thousand annoyances every minute. It is observed by Dr Johnson, that the evil of life does not consist in any sudden and overwhelming crash of misery, but in a series of petty discomforts amd mischiefs continually preying upon the temper. The truth of this maxim, those who emigrate from this country to the back woods of America, will have a good opportunity of verifying. The prevalence of slavery in most of the States of the Union constitutes another capital defect in the structure of American society. These slaves form a degraded and oppressed class, and, in the tyranny exercised over them, they themselves are morally destroyed, while the corruption extends to the other orders of society, equally infecting the oppressed and the oppressor, and debasing the general character and habits of the people. It is vain to talk of liberty while stain of tyranny so deeply infects the domestic manners of a community. There can be no rational liberty unless we call that liberty which gives us the privilege of torturing and oppressing our fellow creatures. To give an idea of the consequences of this dreadful evil of slavery, we may state, that it is a practice in Kentucky to commit delinquent slaves into the hands of the public executioner, by whom they are unmercifully flogged at the markey cross of the different towns, the streets being filled with their pietous cries. What can we think of the people where such spectacles are for a moment tolerated. This is so utterly revolting to every just and enlightened feeling, that to a European it would form a strong objection to his permanent residence in that country. In all the northern states, and in some of the new states, particularly that of the Ohio, slavery is indeed abolished. But in several others the black form a large proportion of the population, and they are not decreasing. We know indeed that this evil is admitted in its full extent by all the American statesmen, that they lament it, but do not well see what measures can be adopted to check it. The importation of new slaves is indeed prohibited, but the increase of those already in the country is the great grievance, against which it is difficult to devise a remedy, and the cruel and oppressive treatment which slaves will always meet with wherever they exist, must tend to degrade the habits and moral feelings of the community at large. To such, therefore, as are accustomed to European society, where no such strain of tyranny infects the domestic manners, an exchange into a community where his feelings may be revolted by spectacles of gross cruelty cannot be regarded as very desirable. If more imperious considerations permit, they have certainly a greater chance for happiness by remaining where the rights of nature are respected, than by removing to a society where every principle of humanity is trampled upon. settlement description;emigration and immigration;wages;disease;national characteristics;slavery
        ID131Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18180226informTo the Editor of the Edinburgh Weekly Journal SIR–It will be remember by many of your Readers, that, in the spring of 1815, proclamations were widely circulated, inviting settlers to Canada.–Having myself occasion to visit this country, I was curious to know what had been the result, especially as I found at Quebec and Montreal very discordant accounts respecting it ; most people asserting that the scheme had failed of success, and that the settlers were in a state of great discomfort and discontent.–To ascertain the truth, I diverged from my route about 50 miles, and spent some days at Perth, situated on the waters of the Redeau, to which a considerable body of the people who accepted the invitation of the Government had been conducted.– Here it traced the reported discontent to some neglect in the general management, and some ill conceieved petty regulations, capriciously exercised towards people tenacious of their rights ; but in the main, universal satisfaction prevailed among the settlers, and a strong feeling of the good intentions of Government towards them. The opportunity being a good one of ascertaining the progress which a promiscious body of settlers make in a given time. I constructed the annexed table, and had each man's signature attached, at once to prove to correctness of his statement, and satisfaction with his situation. Should you think this worthy of publication, you are welcome to publish it in your paper. It may draw attention of a most important subject–the colonization of this province with British subjects ; and it may afford satisfaction to many individuals who may not otherwise know the condition of their friends. The scheme which Government adopted in 1815 was expensive. The settlers had a free passage, rations and tools. Next year rations and tools were furnished to those who came out ; and this year multitudes of poor people have come to Canada, in expectation of being favoured in the same way, but are disappointed ; having nothing given them but land (100 acres each), which many of them from poverty are unable to occupy. Having made it my study, during three months residence here, to inquire into the nature of the country, and into every particular respecting settlement, I am convinced that very simple measures might be adopted, by which the redundant population of Britain could be conveyed by a regular flow into Canada, instead of being wasted, as it now is, to the great prejudice of British interest, over the whole of American ; and were such measures adopted, this province would, in a very few years, be quite equal to its defence in war against the United States –I am, Sir, yours, &c.

        ID134Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18190102persuadeIn answer to the remarks which appeared in our paper on Monday last, respecting emigration to America, and to the statements there given of the disadvantages which emigrants from this country might expect to meet with, we have received a very abusive letter from an anonymous correspondent, who appears very angry, and, like most other angry men, seems more anxious to give full vent to his wrath than to assign any good reason for it. His first cause of quarrel is, that we have stated the general want of cleanliness to be a prevailing defect in the back parts of the United States. For this we have the authority of almost every traveller who has visited those parts. The remarks of Birkbeck on this point are conclu-sive and striking: – ' In viewing the Americans (he observes) and ' sketching, in a rude manner, as I pass along, ' their striking characteristics, I have seen a de' formity so general, that I cannot help esteem' ing it national, though I know it admits of ve' ry many individual exceptions. I have written ' it, and then erased it, wishing to pass it by, ' but it wont do – it is the truth, and to the truth ' I must adhere. Cleanliness in houses, and too ' often in person, is neglected to a degree which ' is very revolting to an Englishman. ' America was bred in a cabin ; this is not a ' reproach – for the origin is most honourable ; ' but as she has exhanged her hovel of unhewn ' logs for a framed building, and that again for ' a mansion of brick, some of her cabin habits ' have been unconsciously retained. Many have ' already been quitted, and one by one they will ' all be cleared away, as I am told they are now ' in the cities of the eastern states. ' There are, I believe, court-houses, which ' are also made us of as places of worship, in ' which filth of all kinds has been accumulating ' ever since they were built. What reverence ' can be felt for the majesty of religion, or of ' the laws, in such styles of abomination ? The ' people who are content to assemble in them ' can scarcely respect each other. Here is a bad ' public example. It is said that to clean those ' places is the office of no one. But why is no ' person appointed ? Might it not be inferred ' that a disregard to the decencies of life prevails ' through such a community?' To the same purpose Cobbett complains of the ' general (for there are many exceptions) sloven' liness about the homsteads, and particularly ' about the dwellings of labourers. Mr Birkbeck ' complains of this, and indeed what a contrast ' with the homesteads and cottages which he left ' behind him, near the exemplary spot, Guild' ford, in Surrey.' He then proceeds to give the reasons for this. When the first settlers took possession of the country, the ' example of neat' ness (he observes) was wanting. There were ' no gentlemn's gardens, kept as clean as ' drawing-rooms, with grass as even as a car' pet. From endeavouring to imitate perfec' tion men arrive at mediocrity ; and those who ' never have seen or heard of perfection in these ' matters, will naturally be slovens.' He afterwards remarks – ' The market day at Guildford is a perfect ' show of cleanliness. Not even a carter without ' even a clean smock-frock, and closely shaven ' and clean washed face. Well may Mr Birkbeck, ' who came from this very spot, think the people ' dirty in the western country. I'll engage he ' finds more dirt upon the necks and faces of one ' family of his present neighbours, than he left ' behind upon the skins of all the people in ' the three parishes of Guildford. However, he ' would not have found this to be the case in ' Pennsylvania, and especially in those parts where ' the Quakers abound ; and, I am told, that in ' the New England States, the people are as ' cleanly and as neat as they are in England. ' The sweetest flowers, when they become pu' trid, stink the most, and a nasty woman is the ' nastiest thing in nature.' In answer to all this, our correspondent tells us, that the Scotch are very dirty. This, we admit, was formerly, and may still continue in some degree to be, the reproach of the Scotch. But does this reasonable person mean to argue from this, that dirty habits are amiable, and ought not to be corrected. With regard to the difficulties of effecting a settlement, we are borne out in our remarks on this subject by the authority of various writers, and principally by the autheor of the Emigrant's Guide, a work of great merit, which combines an extent and precision of statistical information altogether unequally, with the most enlarged general views of the state of the country, both physical and moral. ' Most men (observes ' this judicious writer) on arriving in the United ' States, expects too much. Perhaps the only ' essential advantages offered are the security of ' person and property, and the cheapness of land. ' It demands excessive labour, severe economy, ' and exepmtions from extraordinary accident, to ' succeed in a newly settled country ; and it de' mands the permanency of this continued la' bour, prudence, and favourable circumstances.' Our anonymous correspondent is also extremely displeased that we have stated so strongly the perincious effects produced on the general manners of the Americans by the existence of slavery ; and he mentions that many a labourer in this country might envy the condition of an American slave. What are those privileges for which a free man should envy a slave he does not think proper to state. To show, however, that we have not exaggerated the degradation and oppression of the coloured class in the United States, we shall again adduce the authority of the Emigrant's Guide. The author is contradicting the notion that the labourer in the slave States is confounded with the negroe ; and he expresses himself in the following terms: – ' A residence of 16 years in places where sla' very is prevalent, enables us to contradict a ' general expression, that, in such places, whites, ' performing manual labour, are confounded in ' the moral estimates of the people with slaves. ' Though less respect is certainly paid to useful ' labour in the slave states than where all the ' duties are performed by whites, yet ' the distance between the two races of men are ' in all cases immense. So deep, profound, and ' inveterate is the feeling on that subject, that ' not any where in the United States can pro' perty, sobriety, intelligence, and every other ' advantage, expect colour, raise in public opi' nion a man the most remotely allied to the ' African, to a rank equal to the meanest white. ' Any person who resides a few years in Louisi' ana will be witness to some very remarkable ' exemplifications of this innate contempt for all ' those who affinity involve them in the con' tumely heaped upon men degraded by slavery.' What a picture is here conveyed of misery and degradation on the one hand, and of tyranny on the other. – Here we find it failry confessed that no degree of worth, whether moral or intel lectual, not even the possession of property, can give a man the least degree of consideration in the eyes of the privileged class. We cannot conceive a community more wretchedly constituted. All that is estimable and worthy is here utterly contemned, because the individual who possesses these qualities happens to have his skin of a particular colour, and thus a merely accidental quality of the corporeal frame entails upon its unhappy possessor everlasting ignominy and contempt. These distinctions, carried to such an excess, seem to us to be founded on the extinction of every generous and honourable sentiment, and we cannot help still asserting that we had rather live we at present are, than in a community where such hateful antipathies rule to the exclusion of every just and humane feeling. With regard to the condition of the negroe slaves we shall quote a passage from Brown's Western Gazetteer or Emigrant's Directory after reading which, we shall leave our anonymous correspondent to say whether he thinks the condition of a labourer in this country preferable to that of being an African slave. The writer, describing the town of Lexington, in Kentucky, observes – ' In this square stands the market-house, ' which is of brick, and well furnished on Wed' nesdays and Saturdays ; but occasionally the ' scene of a barbarous practise ; for it is here ' that incorrigible or delinquent negroes are ' flogged unmercifully. I saw this punishment ' inflicted on two of these wretches. Their ' screams soon collected a numerous crowd ; I ' could not help saying to myself, These cries ' are the knell of Kentucky libery.' Having made this answer to the angry charges thus brought against us, we have only to disclaim, in the strongest terms, all hostility or prejudice against the Americans. We have no wish either to depreciate their character or institutions. They exhibit the interesting spectacle of a nation advancing with an irresistible pace to wealth and greatness. To revile such a people would be the height of human folly, and equally foolish is it for their blind admirers to take offence because endeavour to make a fair estimate of their character, without hiding any of its defects. emigration and immigration;settlement description;national characteristics;newspapers;slavery
        ID136Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18190104informReform in Upper Canada It has been already mentioned that Governor Maitland, on opening the session of the Legislature of Upper Canada, recommended that measures should be taken to prevent the meeting of delegates for obtaining reform in Upper Canada. Accounts from Quebec and Montreal, dated the end of November, state, that in pursuance of this recommendation, the Legislature, on one of the first days of its meeting, appointed a Committee to inquire into the subject, who almost instantly came to the following resolution Resolved, That it is the opinion of this Committee that some such legislative provision should be enacted as the wisdom of the Imperial Parliament has found it proper to provide to meet similar occasions, to put it out of the power of any designing persons to organize discontent. The proceeding appears to have raised the indignation of the Gourlay or reforming party in Upper Canada, as will be seen by the following extract :– Montreal, November 21. This legislative provision, it will be immediate ly perceived, is the suspension of the Habeas Corpus act, for that was the course pursued in England. We do not believe that there is the most remote necessity for such a measure. We do not hesitate to say, that the members have not spoken the sentiments of heir constituents, in their echo of Sir P. Maitland's speech, with the most humiliating servility ; and we feel convinced that it will not be borne with by the people, while they have the control in any way of their representatives. The sentiment therein attempted to be disseminated is an libel on the truly loyal people of Upper Canada. It would sound in our ears like the knell of their liberty, if we were not persuaded, that its adoption would provoke a spirit of resistance, not corporal, but mental ; not secret and illegal, but open and legitimate, which (if the Administration do not take the decision of the question from the people by force, and we believe they cannot nor dare not) will serve to purge the constitution of the united province from the injury which it has received by mal-administration. undefined
        ID137Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18190329informNew colony in Lower Canada The following curious notice is extracted from a Quebec paper:– Interesting to thousands! – Colony of Brotherly Union. It is in agitation to found a colony upon the ancient Spartan plan, sanctioned by apostolical usage, of living a common, and enjoying a community of goods. In this establishment, as each will labour for all, and all for each, personal property will be unknown – and all Just of priate gain, engendered by an imperfect organization of society, will be sacrificed at the shrine of public felicity To carry this project into execution, a fertile tract of land, consisting of some thousands of acres, is on the point of being purchased and surveyed Husbandmen and artisans of every sort are invited to this colonization. We tender the right hand of fellowship to the honest and industrious of every description of people, whatever be their religious of political faith. Want of funds will not furnish a reason for excluding any colonist ; and, on the other hand, it will be a fundamental law of this establishment, that whatever property may be, by adventurers, put into the common stock, will be considered as a loan, and refunded to them r their assignees on demand. The colony will be situated within the bounds of Lower Canada, and under the protection and control of his Majesty's Government. All persons who are willing to embark in this enterprise are requested to address themselves to the subscribers, personally or by letter. They will specify their country, age, profession, number of children (if married) , propery, &c. No letter will be received by from principals, nor unless post paid – Every letter to bear on its superscription the words, ' Colony of Brotherly Union.' s soon as a sufficient number of applicants shall have inrolled their names, notice will given by public advertisement to convene and digest a code of laws and regulations for the establishment. S.

        ID141Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18190527informExtract of a letter from William Hunt, esq. To H. Hunt, esq. Washington Hotel, New Orleans, Dec. 25. 1818. My Dear Brother – We arrived safe in the mouth of the Mississippi on the 10th of this month, after a voyage of 82 days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in excellent health, and very happy. There are 35 English vessels from Liverpool now here, and a great many English emigrants from Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Lancashire, Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Somersetshire ; and, in fact, from almost all parts of the heavily-taxed island we have left behind us ! Our ship was detained near a week in the river, about 80 miles below New Orleans ; we all went on shore, and had plenty of rabbit shooting. I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun, by Knock, corner of Fetter-lane. Henry, myself, and Mr Blake went one day into the woods to kill deer, by night coming on, we lost our road ; and, differing in opinions, we separated, Henry and Mr Blake taking one road, and myself the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at ten o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods, and did not return to us till the next morning. It being wet, and Henry sleeping on the marshy ground, in spite of the remonstrances of Mr Blake, caught a severe cold, and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days, but he is now perfectly recovered : he is grown fat. In the river there are thousands of wild swans, wild geese, wild ducks, woodcocks, snipes, and other wild fowl. If you were there, you would kill a waggon load in a day, as I know you have frequently killed a horse load in England ; but they are a thousand times more numerous here than I ever saw them in England ; this market swarms with them, and very cheap. No game certificate required here. Myself, Henry, Mr Blake, and the other passengers, visited a French farmer, about six miles below New Orleans : he has got 3000 acres of his own land, whereon are sugar plantations, sugar-houses, & c. ; he made 250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last year. He offers five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter, as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of French settlements on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are the most slovenly and the worst farmers I ever saw. – They are very lazy, bad managers, and appear to use their negroes very cruel, and work them very hard. The Europeans generally leave New Orleans in the summer, as it is very unhealthy in the hot weather and the deaths are frequently seventy in a week. The scenery of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much like the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and Staines, and many of the buildings are as handsome as those of Bath. Here is one Church, which is a very beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spanish shops are all open, and it is a market during the whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the evening, gambling & c. We are at the Washington Hotel, the best in the city ; it is expensive, although very good living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each, including claret and rum and water. There is no beer here in warm weather as in England, and it is as warm here now as it was in England in July, although not half so oppressive and stinking as it was in Covent Garden during the election : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel, most of them English. We do not trouble ourselves about politics in this country ; our object is to cultivate the soil, and to reap the fair reward of our labour. On Saturday we were charged 100 dollars each for passage, and four dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three and a half tons weight with us. Do pray send me four quarters of the best peas, rye, grass seed, and some more of Hill's Scots ploughs, to be left at Messrs Brown and Co. who will forward them carefully to me at the Illinois. Mr Trimmer, an Englishman, has purchased 20,000 acres of land near Mr Birkbeck, and has taken twenty couple of hounds with him, so that we shall have some hunting as well as shooting if we like. It is said that he is about to marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he tells me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all over the Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they are the only thing wanting there. I should have brought over some with me, but they may follow us ; as I understand the labourers, with the pay of a dollar a day, can live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer of L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply, and others that I have seen from Illinois, report that the farmer can get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says there is a good sure market, and a fair profit and only one penny per acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we shall have to pay. Price of labour is very dear here ; we pay a dollar for washing every dozen of shirts, cravats, pocket handkerchiefs, & c. & c. The price of a gallon of best rum is one and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my things shipped from England, I have paid 92 dollars for. Although I should like England very well if it was not for the taxes, yet, from what I have seen hitherto, I like America ten times better emigration and immigration;settlement description;national characteristics;slavery;religion;wages
        ID142Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18190527informEmigration to America Important Extracts of a Letter from a very Intelligent and respectable Engineer in Louisville, dated January 20. 1819. The best time for coming to America I should judge to be in the summer, to land in September, so as to be able to get here before the weather was too cold. It is safe to settle in the beginning of winter or spring, so as to inure to the climate by degrees. The best plan for coming is to take a part of the steerage of a vessel, and find your own provisions; you will save more in this way, over a cabin passage, than would buy a decent farm here. The lands in this neighbourhood raise a crop of wheat and one of corn alternately, and improve ; dung is never applied, and is said to be hurtful. It is without question what the land here is as good as can be, and when to this is added the heat of the summer, one ought to be able to raise crops as heavy as they will stand. You wonder at 10 dollars being enough to clear an acre. It is not cleared, all the trees under 12 inches are cut down and burned on the ground, and the large ones are killed by cutting round the bark. The ground is then prepared for Indian corn by scratching it with a hoe, or a kind of shuffle, which, from the looseness and mellowness of the soil, is easily done, and in this way sixty or eighty bushels an acre are sometimes raised. – the trees die in a few months, and in three or four years fall down one by one, and the roots will rot out in seven or eight years. It is a great want of sense in any new settler not to adopt the modes of this country, proven to be the best adapted to the state of it by 200 years experience. The Americans, of all other people I know of, are the most ingenious in adapting the means to the end. I do not know if they have more sense than other nations, but they certainly make it go farther. Every tools answers the purpose most effectually. This is evident in their axes. An American will cut down three times more trees and square three times more timber than the best of your wrights could do, and not by more strength but by fitter tools. So it is with cutting their grain ; a man will cut down four acres of wheat in a day, what what he calls a cradle scythe, and lay it as refular for binding as reapers can do. Sixty bushels of Indian corn is the average of Kentucky ; but 25 bushels of wheat is about the average of an acre. It is easier farming here than with you on sundry accounts ; the soil is free, few weeds make their appearance, and when ploughed down are certainly killed by the hot sun. There are no frosts to injure the crop, and no wet weather to destroy it when cut. Hay is made in two days, and grain is cut one day and stacked or housed the next. From the shortness and mildness of the winter, little provender is needed for the stock. Swine are raised at no expence. They breed and feed in the woods, and only want from one to three bushels of corn to fatten for killing, when they sell for five cents a lb. In the less settled parts of the country, it is the practise to give all the corn to swine and then send them to market. A bushel of corn is equal in nutriment to a bushel of wheat for man or beast. undefined
        ID143Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18190507informThe brig Henry sailed from Cork on Wednesday se'ennight, with about two hundred passengers for Aux Cayes, to join Sir Gregor M'Gregor, who lately landed on the Spanish Main with a small force. General M'Gregor, it seems, left authority with Colonel Eyre to recruit men for his service, and to ship them as he best could. – There are a number of idle gentlemen about Dublin at present, and also many in the country, who have been captivated with the speculation of embarking in the Patriotic cause, and for some time they have appeared in the streets in fanciful uniforms. We understand that Col. Eyre has formed a Committee, who treat with such young gentlemen as have the inclination to proceed on the enterprise, and have money to pay for such rank as they may wish to possess under M'Gregor. The money thus furnished is made a stock purse to pay the freight of the vessel, and hence it is necessary that the greater part of the adventurers should be officers ; for those who are contented with the humble station of privates are not required to contribute and their passage, subsistence, &c. must be defrayed by the common fund. Mr D'Evereaux, from the county of Wexford, is also raising men for the same service, but under different circumstances. He professes to have authority from General Bo livar to grant commissions, and to ship the men he may raise for head-quarters in Venezuela. Mr D'Evereaux has not yet dispatched any men, and Col. Eyre has certainly shewn more activity in this respect. – Dublin Journal. undefined
        ID145Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18190628persuadeEmigration. The increased population of this country, as well as the great difficult to which the middling classes of society are exposed in their efforts to procure the ordinary means of sustenance, has given rise to the formation of little copartnerships, or joint stock companies of individuals, who, being unable to command capital enough singly, to encounter the expences of a new settlement, have put their little funds together, with a determination to sail for America, and there jointly to labour for the general good of the whole, until fortune shall so far favour their efforts as to enable them to become independent of each other. By this means much less than the hundred pounds stipulated by Mr Birkbeck as the proper stock for an emigrant to begin with, will be sufficient ; and thus a new impetus will be given to that tide of huma beings which is constantly flowing towards the new world. Would it not be policy to give encouragement to these industrious swarms to settle in our own colonies? We have heard with some pleasure in rumour that several parishes have taken into their serious consideration the prudence of establishing a fund for the encouragement of those poor persons who may be dispoed to seek a means of occupation in Canada ; in furtherance of which laudable design, an application is to be made to Government for grants of land in desirable siutations, especially in Upper Canada, where the climate is described to be of the finest description. There is no doubt that many who are now pining in workhouses would gladly accept of such an alternative, and who, instead of being, as at present, a burthen to themselves and to society, would, by their exertions, be adding to the importance and stability of our possessions in that quarter, as well as opening a new source for the consumption of our manufactures. undefined
        ID146Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18190628informLetter from Mr Morris Birkbeck English Prairie, (Illinoia,) Nov.25. 1818. Sir – Your favour of 15th June is before me. Presuming you retain a copy of the queries, I proceed to answer then in order: – Respecting domestic servants ; what may be the condition of our colony in two years it is impossible to foresee, but should it be in your power to bring with you female domestics, it would be well to do so ; also a carpenter or two and a few labourers ; if with families, so much the better. Written engagements for a term, or indentures, are not binding, unless renewed on this side of the Atlantic. I have not seen any of these documents, and can therefore give you no precise directions for them : perhaps a simple engagement from the parties, acknowledging as a debt the expence incurred in bringing our, might be a sufficient security, leaving their wages to be determined here according to the current rates, yet to be established by the proportion of supply to the demand, which, as I remarked above, it is now impossible to ascertain. As to the number of labourers, or female domestics, you would need perhaps six of the former and two of the latter would a safe adventure, looking to the colony for an addition, should you need it, after you are settled – before that you will find a greater number an incumbrance : this is, I think, all I can say to your first, third, fourth, and fifth queries. All expence of transfer of your family and luggage, supposing the latter to weigh ten thousand pounds, I should estimate under L.1000 sterling. On this particular subject Mr R. Flower would give you most particular information – The luggage would cost about ten dollars per 100 lbs. So much for your query. To the seventh query – I think L.200 would assist your family in plenty for a year, exclusive of wages and clothing. Eighth query – L.3000 would be a good capital for a section, or 640 acres, and I question your wishing to hold in cultivation a larger tract. Ninth query – I consider our situation not liable to future disturbance from Indians, in the event of a war between Great Britain and the United States, being covered by increasing settlements to the west, north-west, and north. Tenth query – The earthquakes mentioned by Bradbury I have heard of from many persons ; but I have not discovered that it has left any impression on the public mind ; on this score, for my own part, I feel no anxiety about the matter ; Great Britain, I suppose, in proportion to its dimensions, is equally liable to earthquakes.

When due precaution against the diseases of the climate are observed, I have never failed to recommend it. Twelfth query – The health of my family has not suffered from the climate. One of my sons has been affected with ague. This summer has been more sickly in these parts than any season for seven years past, and has afforded me a most encouraging confirmation of the temperature and salubrity of our settlement, and has also afforded immeasurable proofs of those facts regarding the sufferings of new settlers, to which I have so anxiously invited the attention of the readers of my journal. On the whole, provided common sense should be seconded by common industry, in the inclosure and cultivation of our colony, I think we shall not be visisted by more than our due share of physical calamity. I deferred noticing your second query, the subject being connected with the proposal respecting land, at the conclusion of your letter. I would strongly recommend your deferring the purchase of land until your arrival. It would be difficult to convey to you the reasons, but you would feel the propriety of my advice, should you come. I think you would have as good a choice two years hence as now, because excellent siutations, as yet unsurveyed, will then be on sale. I have no eligible offer to make you beyond a section. You inquire concerning venomous reptiles ; they are no source of injury or alarm to us. Insects, in new countries, often abound to an astonishing degree, and are sufficiently teazing to man and beast. Many species yield instantly to cultivation, and are heard of no more as plagues ; others will continue until conquered by order and industry. The thermometer ranges from 13 below zero to 89 above ; the extremes are, of course, of rare occurence, and short duration. At Philadelphia, I understand, it rose this summer 97, and in this neighbourhood, in the low river bottoms, I believe it might reach that degree. On our praire I think it never reached 89. The smaller streams are rapid and soon dry ; the larger sluggish in the extreme – catfish, perch, sturgeons abound, and many others I believe. I think 1000 dollars would build a comfortable plain dwelling. – Your obedient servant, M. Birkbeck. Directed to W. Wilson, Esq. Batson's Coffeehouse, London. undefined

It will be read with peculiar interest, and it enables us to answer, in the most satisfactory manner, the many inquiries which have been addressed to us, upon the nature and extent of the plan of which the Chancellor of the Exchequer submitted an outline to Parliament just before its prorogation. ( Official Circular. Downing Street, London, 1819. I have to acquaint you in reply to your letter of the –, that the following are the conditions under which it is proposed to give encouragement to emigration to the Cape of Good Hope. The sufferings to which many individuals have been exposed, who have emigrated to his Majesty's foreign possessions, unconnected and unprovided with any capiral, or even the means of support, having been very afflicting to themselves, and equally burdensome to the colonies to which they have proceeded, the Government have determined to confine the application of the money recently voted by address in the House of Commons, to those persons, who possessing the means, will engage to carry out, at the least, ten able bodied individuals above 18 years of age, with or without families, the Government always reserving to itself the right of selecting from the several offers made to them those which may prove, upon examination, to be most eligible. In order to give some security to the Government, that the persons undertaking to make these establishments have the means of doing so, every person engaging to take out the above mentioned number of persons or families shall deposit at the rate of L.10 (to be repaid as hereinafter mentioned) for every famly so taken out, provided that the family does not consist of more than one man, one woman, and two children under 14 years of age. All children above the number of two will have to be paid for, in addition to the deposit above mentioned, in the proportion of L.5 for every two children under 14 years of age and L.5 for every person between the ages of 14 and 18. In consideration of this deposit, a passage shall be provided at the expence of Government for the settlers, who shall also be victualled from the time of their embarkation until the time of their landing in the colony. A grant of land, under the conditions hereafter specified, be made to him at the rate of 100 acres for every such person or family whom he shall so take out ; one-third of the sum advanced to Government on the outset shall be repaid on landing, when the victualling at the expence of Government shall cease. A further proportion of onethird shall be repaid, as soon as it shall be certified to the Governor of the colony that the settlers under the direction of the person taking them out are actually located upon the land assigned to them ; and the remainer at the expiration of three months from the date of their location. If any parishes in which there may be a redundancy of population shall unite in selecting an intelligent individual to proceed to the Cape, with settlers under his direction, not less in number and of the description abovementioned, and shall advance money in the proportion above-mentioned, the Government will grant land to such an individual at the rate of 100 acres for every head of a family, leaving the parish at liberty to make such conditions with the individual, or the settlers, as may be calculated to prevent the parish becoming again chargeable with the maintenance of such settlers, in the event of their return to this country. But no offers of this kind will be accepted, unless it shall be clear that the persons proposing to become settlers shall have distinctly given their consent, and the head of each family is not infirm or incapable of work. It is further proposed, that in any case in which one hundred families proceed together, and apply for leave to carry out with them a minister of their own persuasion, Government will, upon their being actually located, assign a salary to the minister who they have may have selected to accompany them, if he shall be approved by the Secretary of State. The lands will be granted at a quit rent to be fixed, which rent, however, will be remitted for the first ten years ; and at the expiration of three years (during which the party and a number of families, in the proportion of one for every 100 acres, must have resided on the estate), the land shall be measured at the expence of Government, and the holder shall obtain, without fee, his title thereto, on a perpetual quit rent, not exceeding in any case L. 2 sterling for every 100 acres ; subject, however to this clause beyond the usual reservations–that the land shall become forefited to Government, in case the party shall abandon the estate, or not bring it into cultivation within a given number of years. I am Your most obedient humble servant. * The usual reservations are the right of the Crown to mines of precious stones, of gold and silver, and to make such roads as may be necessary for the convenience of the colony. emigration and immigration

        ID157Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18190215informEmigration to America [ From the Observer. ] The following letter from a lady who emigrated to America, from within four miles of Godalming, in Surrey, two years back, has been handed to us for insertion. During the present rage for emigration, we think we are justified in giving it insertion, leaving it to those who are interested in its contents to draw their own con clusions. We have reason to conclude that the letter is genuine, and is not, we believe, as many have been which have found their way into the public press, the produce of ingenuity on this side the Atlantic: – Philadelphia, July 29. 1818 My dear Sir – I have received your welcome letter, together with the patterns you were kind enough to forward Although our habits here are in many respects different from those on your side of the Atlantic, yet, I assure, there is a considerable degree of anxiety among our American belles for English fasions ; and the display which your prompt attention to my request has enabled me to make, has procured me not alone a great influx of visitors, but of business. You ask me to give you my candid opinion of the policy of removing hither with your wife and family. I can have no hesitation in complying with this request ; but, at the same time, I shrink from the responsibility of your being persuade, from any things which I may say, to follow my example. It is impossible to disguise from myself, and I would not attempt to disguise it from you, that many who have come here, anticipating prosperity and independence, have failed ; but, at the same time, as far as my humble observation has enabled me to judge, I am persuaded that many of those failures have been the result of unpardonable imprudence, and the absence of that activity and spirit of perseverance, by which persons depending on their own exertions can alone expect to succeed. I have seen many individuals here reduced to very melancholy straits from having left their native shores thoughtlessly, without more money than was sufficient to support them for a fortnight. –. This has been dissipated, on their landing, almost before they had recovered the effects of a long and fatiguing voyage ; and being thus reduced to extremity, their spirits have failed, and they have at once sunk into a state of apathy and listless despair. Those who have labouring and mechanic trades to follow, and will sumbit to degradation, as some of them call it, of becoming journeymen, do tolerably well. With regards to myself, I need not recall to your mind the species of drudgery to which I was forced to submit, in order to support a decent appearance in London. You often joked me on my enterprising disposition, and doubted my resolution to come to this country in search of that independence which I foresaw I could never obtain at home. Here I am, however, and an hour since I had the pleasure of paying 30 work women, the lowest of whose weekly wages, I those who take their work home, is five dollars! You will start at this and so will Mrs B. It is, however, no less true than extraordinary. In short I have every reason to be grateful to Providence for having given me the confidence to sufficient to try an experiment which has turned out so fortunately. I have commenced both millinery and dress-making, to which I have added the childbed and ready made linen business ; and in every one of branches I am full of orders. My most sanguine hopes have been realized. My capital at the beginning was exactly 1.60 Sterling and a few of those articles of stock which were necessary to make a show. These, combined with the attractive titled of Miss P–, from London,'&c. in a few weeks set me afloat in a surprising manner. I did my utmost to please my customers, and, in a few months, moved from a situation of obscurity to one of the first respectability. I am thus particular because I know you feel an interest in my fate. My brother James, who you know is a bricklayer and builder, has been equally fortunate.– He has had several contracts, and is now building a row of twenty houses, besides other jobs of a smaller description. Of the other fiften persons who accompanied us from Godalmbing and its neighbourhood I am proud to say they have all been tolerably successful. The greater part of them, you know, were farmers, and they are now settled in farms of from fifty to five hundred acres, from one hundred to one thousand miles from this place. All these, hoever, came out with small capitals–but none with less than myself–and husbanding their resources, and abstaining from extravagance of every description, they finally successed in laying the foundation of their own future happiness. We all have our own prejudices in favour of our old habits ; but this must wear off in the course of time?other there is a roughness and absence of what we call good manners about some of the Americans, not at all congenial to English taste. They are for the most part, however, hospitable ; and if you let them have their way, and do not thwart their humours, are really very kind, and disposed to friendly intercourse. You talk to carrying your family to the Western states–to the Illinois country, and of commencing farmer and storekeeping there. It is probably that your views may be very correct, but I think you may settle nearer to us, if not at so cheap a rate, at best with a greater certainty of present comfort. Of the Western States, I, of course, can know nothing but by report. The emigration in that direction has been immense, but the journey to some has been so long, as frequently to produce repentance before the destined goal was reached. We have had several English, Scotch, and Irish families here, on the way to Pittsburgh, who, I understand, were bound for Mr Birkbeck's settlement ; but I have not heard of their arrival. The greater part have gone down the Ohio in arks, which you say you have seen described in Birk beck's books. No doubt these people must have to encounter great privations, and perhaps some danger ; time and perseverance, however,will overcome all difficulties, and from the natural course of things, in the end the great object in view, plenty and independence, must be attained ; and this as you very justly say, is worth a struggle. Upon the whole, if you can be content to give up all those luxuries of which an English fireside is the scene ; to abandon the habits of social intercourse to which an English neighbourhood give encouragement ; and to derive happiness from the consciousness of seeing yourself surrounded by an abundance of the necessaries of life alone ; you cannot fail of success. I agree with you, that a vast deal of the pleasure of England are counterbalanced by the castant visitation of the tax-gathered. From these, at least you will be free here ; and as for society, your own family, large as it is, must be a treasure in itself ; added to which, in proportion as wealth increases, civilisation must follow. If you could get three or four families with whom you are acquainted, to join in your plans and settle in your neighbourhood, an additional assuance of success and happiness would be attained. As to capital, I think you ought to hav, on your landing here, L. 500, which, with moderate exertions and common good fortune, must afford yo uthe means of certain prosperity. I shall, however, write again in September on this subject, when I intend sending for my sister, and perhaps the information I may be able to collect in the interim will confirm your plans, and induce you to accompany her to this side of the water. I rather think we shall shortly have another cargo from Surrey ; I will let you know every particular in my next, as well as send you a list of the things, which it will be policy for you to bring with you. Your seven children, instead of being a burden to you here, will form one of the most prominent sources of your wealth. undefined
        ID158Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18200113informEmigration to Canada. About ten days ago an emigrant arrived from Canada, to Paisley, and brings very favourable intelligence from that country. He is a native of Scotland ; was some time in the army ; and is going home again, as he calls it, early in the spring. This person gives the most satisfactory and cheering account of the place, and says his chief complaint was the want of society to share in his felicities, to be companion of his joys, and to exult in his abundance. He adds that one of his principal reasons for coming here at present was hearing of our distressed condition, and that he might be able to persuade others to follow his example ; anxious to be surrounded by happy, intelligent, and social neighbours. His arrival and narrations, combined with other circumstances, have been the subject of considerable discussion the whole of last week. A strong desire for emigration has been manifested, and about 300 have already subscribed their names, as a testimony of their ardour to go away. A petition is immediately to be forwarded to his Majesty's Ministers, imploring their assistance by way of loan or donation, to enable them to carry their wishes into execution. This petition, it is said, is to be supported by the principal gentlemen of the county, and the utmost anxiety will doubtless prevail concerning its success. – Let us hope that Government will see the necessity of attending to the supplications of these people. The Sheriff Depute has been memorialized upon the subject, to give his counsel and support in behalf of the measure, and it is much to his honour that he has evinced a great disposition to favour the object in view. His office has been appointed for the reception of signatures, where the persons experience the greatest kindness in every possible way. It is proper, at the same time, to mention, that a number who were wishing to subscribe as desirous to emigrate, have been rejected ; as their circumstances were not of that despairing nature as to warrant an interposition of this kind in their favour. It cannot be expected that those who enjoy a considerable degree of comfort at home, or who have sufficient means of their own to emigrate without public aid, ought to be included among that number destined to participate in this salutary and benevolent proposition. Some of the fiercer radicals, with their accustomed zeal and spleen, are busily employed in jeering and deprecating the idea of emigration and telling the people to stay and help in the recovery of their rights. They declare the whole scheme to be a mere farce, intended to be played against them, in order to destroy the unanimity which they say exists in the nation concerning their grand object. These querulous politicians complain of the climate of Canada, and it must be granted that it resembles Italy more than Scotland, being hotter in summer and coller in winter than our own island but the country is healthy, the soil is fruitful and strong constitutions and longevity are as common there as in any other part of the globe. The same manners, language, and regulations prevail in Upper Canada as in Scotland, and when people have plenty of provisions, fuel and warm clothing to resist the effects of heavy snows and intense frosts, the objection of cold is less worthy of consideration. – Glasgow Chronicle. undefined
        ID159Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18200124entertainDutch Colonial Law, and Negro Fortitude. (From Lavaysse's Account of Venezuela, Trinidad, Margaritta, and Tobago, just published.) Stedman, after having given a picture of the cruelties practised on the negroes at Surinam, relates that on his arrival in that colony, a white man was flagged by a black executioner, for having stolen some money from the townhouse ; and he remarked that this negro inflicted the punishment with great signs of commiseration. A negro was broken on the wheel for the same crime, and he bore that horrible punishment without a sigh. A moment afterwards, they prepared to hang another, and whilst the hangman was tying the cord round his neck to launch him into eternity, he looked steadfastly, with a smile of contempt, at his judges, who were among the spectators of the execution. Having expressed to the persons who were near me, (says Captain Stedman) how much I was shocked with the injustice and cruelty of those executions, and surprised at the intrepidity of the negroes during the punishment, a very decent looking man thus addressed me ; Sir, you are newly arrived from Europe ; but if you were better acquainted with negro slaves, what you now see would neither excite your surprise nor your pity. It is not long since I saw a negro suspended from that very gibbet by the ribs. The following is the manner in which it was done : two incisions were made in his side, in which was passed an iron hook attached to a chain. He lived three days suspended in that manner, his head and feet hanging down, licking from his bleeding breast the drops of water that fell on it, for it rained at the time. The sufferer did not, however, utter a groan, and never once complained. On the third day, another negro was flogged under the gallows, and having cried from pain, the former reproached him for his want of courage: Are you a man? said he to him, you behave like a child! – A moment afterwards the soldier who was sentry on the spot taking pity on him, dashed out his brains with the butt end of his musquet. I saw another negro quartered, the narrator: After his arms and legs were tied to four very strong horses, an iron nail was driven under each nail of his hands and feet He suffered that without complaining, requested a glass of ru,, and ordered the executioners to let loose the horses. But that which amused us most, continued this monster, was the humour of the fellow, who, when the hangman presented the glass of rum to him that he had asked for, told him to drink first, as he was very much afraid of bepoisoned, and desired him to take care that his horses should not kick him. As for old negroes being broken on the wheel, and young women burnt alive, nothing is more common in this colony! undefined

The whole of the freemasons of Halifax went in grand procession. They formed in lodges at their hall, and, preceded by a military band, and followed by another, they marched to the places prepared for them on the building. His Lordship came on the scaffolding at two o'clock, the grenadiers of the 62d regiment being his guard of honour. Detachments from each regiment kept the ground. After a prayer by the Rev. Mr Twining, Grand Chaplain, Lord Dalhousie addressed the assembly in a speech, of which I have not time to give an outline ; but in it his Lordship mentioned, that the building was intendeed as a college upon the plan of that of Edinburgh, where all students who professed the Christian religion were eligible for admittance. Strangers residing here for a short time might also enjoy the benefit of the institution, and gentlemen in the army, the navy, and the military establishments. His Lordship concluded a most eloquent and animated address with his fervent wishes for the welfare and prosperity of the undertaking. A bottle with coins, and a tin case with parchments, &c. were then severally deposited in the recess made for them, and the stone was lowered into its place with all the requisite and due forms, under a royal salute from fort Charlotte ; after which the Rev. the Grand Chaplain closed the proceedings with a prayer, and the whole assembled multitude gave nine cheers.– The military and masonic processions then returned in the same order, in which they came. The day was beautiful, and a greater assemblage of people was never witnessed in Halifax. The Countess of Dalhousie and her two sons, Mrs Admiral Griffith and the Misses Wilson, and most of the fashionable ladies here witnessed the ceremony from a convenient scaffolding prepared for them. Lord Dalhousie purposes to leave Halifax for Quebec in his Majesty's ship Newcastle, on the 1st of June, without waiting for Sir James Kempt. Court of Chancery –June 10. Will of the Late Duke of Queensberry Mr Head stated, that he had to present a petition from the annuitants and legates of the late Duke of Queensberry, praying that a fourth more of their claims might be paid, there now being sufficient funds in the hands of the Accountant-General for that purposes. The Learned Counsel said, that there was no less a sum than L.1,400,000 accumulated and vested in the name of this officer, in Bank stock, for the benefit of the claimants, and he understood it was not intended to oppose the application, although the executors did not say they would give their consent to it. Some consultation had been had on the subject out of doors ; he therefore prayed that the prayer of the petition should be granted. The Attorney-General said, he had not received any instructions, nor had he been consulted. The several King's counsel in Court spoke in behalf of their respective clients. Mr Wingfield appeared for the Earl of Yarmouth, and said his Lordship was anxious that the business should be put in a train of settlement. The Lord Chancellor said, there was not a man existing that had a heart in him but must wish the legacies and annuities to be paid ; but, said his Lordship, the Marquis of Queensberry has commenced an action for the recovery of L.150,000 against the executor, and he certainly had a right so to do it ; it was, therefore, proper that the Court should see that no harm arose to the executors, before the funds were allowed to go out of Court. With respect to their not opposing the petition, that was very different to consenting to it ; it merely said to the Court, Mind you do right. Mr Heald said, if his Lordship thought that one-fourth was too much, they would take an eight, or any part his Lordship pleased. The Lord Chancellor.–I will order it to stand first on the paper for Tuesday next, and in the mean time I will look over the petition. undefined

This colony in fact is the only country that an Englishman should come to, he neither changes climate not habits, for here every thing hat occurs to him is the same, except burning wood for coals. The country on the sea coast is very woody, but much easier cleared than America and about ten miles in the interior several miles of extent have no wood at all. The ships behaves beautifully, sails well, and is easy ; we have never close reefed and not above twice double reefed, and not strained a rope yarn nor split a sail. Extract of a letter received by My Leyden, R. N. Leith, from his Son, Mate of the ship Skelton, dated Sullivan's Cove, off Hobart Town, 29th November 1820 :– I take this opportunity of sending you a few lines by the ship Guildford, which is to sail tomorrow for Baravia, and then homewards. We left the Table Bay on 18th October, and arrived here on 28th November, making a very good passage. Did not see any vessel on the passage–made the island of Amsterdam and St Paul's on 28 November–went ashore on the island of Amsterdam for two or three hours, found it to be barren entirely–only inhabited by give or six people from the Isle of France, for the purpose of sealing. When we came near the land, fell in with various winds and calms–made the river on Sunday about twelve o'clock, and brought up off Hobart, at three P M on Monday. The country has a very fine prospect, a great deal of wood, but interspersed with fields all in green, for it is the spring here now–the pease are in full bloom. This town is very irregu larly built, just like a Norwegian village–a deal of wooden houses–the appearance of the country pleases the eye greatly of the passengers, and the visit they had from the Deputy Governor was very favourable. Governor M'Quarrie is to be here from Sidney in the course of a fortnight or three weeks to survey the Government works. The passengers are in great suspense whether they will forward themselves to Sydney, or wait until he comes. Butter sells at 4s, a lb ; coarse ship biscuits 35s. a cwt ; a pair of ashets, middle size, 21s. and every thing in like proportion. Salted pork would have sold very well–could clear L130 a cwt. Beef is about 6d. a lb. If you buy any here, and pay in produce, you pay more than in hard cash. There are few bush rangers now, they were mostly all shot in the woods. No encouragement here for pickpockets. Some of the richest and most powerful men here have once been sent out as convicts, but, from their good behaviour, got their emancipation. The Midship Leith, upon the pier, is here ; he is master of a colonial brig trading between Sydney and here. Our passengers tell me they can chuse what land they like ; but not the quality ; they must apply the saw and the hatchet a great deal. A hatchet costs 7s. 6d. a lb. Very few people have female servants, as they can't trust them ; as those who come out are convicts, and get soon married, so they have all men servants. undefined

The gigantic projects that occupy the attention of our countrymen are truly surprising. A plan is now forming, for example, to establish a settlement at the mouth of the river Columbia, for the purpose of importing teas direct from the East Indies. It is then proposed to transport this article of merchandize up the Columbia, until it reaches the rocky mountains, and then to proceed by land to the navigable branch of the Missouri. This embraces a space of three hundred and forty miles in extent. Of this distance 200 miles are represented by travellers as constituting an excellent road ; the remaining one hundred and forty comprehend the mountain barrier, which must be passed by the intrepidity and labour of man. The merchandize will then, by the aid of the Missouri and its subsidiary streams, supply the whole western continent with the refreshing beverage. This shows the varied changes of commerse ; the Atlantic States have heretofore been the medium of supplying our western States with the productions of China ; but if this plan should be carried into effect, we may receive our supply from that country through the western States. May 16. It is worthy of remark, that among the numerous arrivals at this port yesterday, were three British brigs from Dundee. This makes good the remark of a late Scotch gazette, that Dundee was becoming a place of considerable trade. undefined
        ID357Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18170106entertainANOTHER DREADFUL MASSACRE BY THE NATIVES OF THE MARQUESAS ISLANDS. (From the Sydney Gazette, Nov. 8. 1815) By the Governor Macquarrie, are arrived Captain Fowler, and part of the crew of the Indian brig Matilda, which sailed from this colony in August 1813, bound on a voyage to the Derwent and Eastern Islands, and from thence to China, but was cut off and plundered, on the night of the 10th of April last, while lying at anchor in Duff's Bay, at the Island of Rooapoah, one of the Marquesas, on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted, and joining with some of the Rooapoah natives, took the opportunity of a dark night, and the wind blowing fresh right on the land, to cut the vessel adrift, by which means she drove on shore through a heavy surf, and was soon bilged and filled with water. When the cannibal natives saw that it was impracticable to get the vessel afloat, they concurred universally in the design of putting the whole of her crew to death; which appears to have been a constant practise among the different natives towards one another, when their canoes happen to fall upon a strange shore, through stress of weather, or from any other accident. Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their chief, or king, Nooahetu, who presided at the horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate mariners to instant slaughter. He withheld his assent to the murder; but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of the vessel– The crew were informed by such expressions as they could understand, as well as by gesticulations that accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion, that their lives were dependent on the issue; the good chief was opposed to many other chiefs, who, though somewhat inferior in rank, were very far superior in number, supported by the common usages of the island, from which the exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was seated, with his son by his side, on a mat in his own dwelling; he had been called to the supremacy of the island by the general wish of the people, as it was not a hereditary right, but an elective dignity. His people pressed their solicitations earnestly, and at length peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which he for a length of time opposed by the force of words, which not seeming likely to prevail, he adopted a method which silenced the whole in an instant, and saved the lives of Capt. Fowler and his crew. Finding that all his expostulations were defeated, on the principle of undeviating custom, he deliberately took up two ropes that were near him, and fixing one round the neck of his son, and the other round his own, called to the chief next in command, who immediately approached him. His conference was short and decisive: he first pointed to the cord that encircled the neck of his son, and then to the other which he had entwined around his own. These strangers are doomed to death, said he, by my chiefs and my people: and it is not fit that I, who am their King, should live to see so vile a deed perpetrated. Let my child and myself be strangled before it is performed and then it never will be said that we sanctioned, even with our eye-sight, the destruction of these unoffending people. The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce, even in the mind of the unenlightened savage, a paroxysm of surprise, mingled with a sentiment of admiration in which the untaught man may possibly excel his fellow - creature, whose conceptions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For a moment the people looked wildly upon their king, whose person they adored, because that his principles were good, and his government just and mild. They saw the obedient chief, to whom the order of strangulation had been imparted, staring with horror and amazement at the change which a few moments had produced; The mandate which had proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed; and, commanded to perform the dreadful office, he proceeded to obey when a sudden shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance. The King! the King! from every lip burst forth–'What! kill the King! No, no, let all the strangers live–no man shall kill the King! Thus were their lives preserved, and the vessel plundered of every thing on board her. The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at Noorheva, still remains, and is dry at low water. All her iron and copper have been taken out by the natives, who have a thorough know ledge of the use of these materials. That they are cannibals is well ascertained. They form distinct factions, and make war upon the ruling chief. The rebels are denominated the typees; and the opposite parties are horribly sanguinary towards each other. Six of the adverse party were killed and devoured by the rebels while Captain Fowler was among them, and the following de testable circumstance occurred on the occasion: A native man belonging to Port Anna Maria, who was not tattooed, and in consequence prohibited from the eating of human flesh, on pain of death, impatient of the restraint, fell upon one of the murdered bodies, and darting his teeth into it in all the madness of a voracious fury, exhaled the crimson moisture, which had not yet coagulated. The chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very friendly to Europeans, is named Ke-atta-nooe, the first part of the name implying the outrigger of a canoe, and the latter signifying great. The dress of the men consists merely of a wrapper about the waist; the women are covered from the shoulders downwards to the ancles, and are generally fairer than the Taheitan women. The chiefs have no distinguishing mark or ornament, but in the mode of wearing their hair; which the common orders wear tied up in a large knot on each side of the head, a stripe of which, extending from the forehead to the hollow of the neck, is kept shorn, which practice the chiefs do not adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the worms to be more prevalent and destructive to the ship's bottoms there than he has any where else witnessed; and to this cause attributes the caution of the natives in drawing up their largest canoes, some of which contain from 80 to 100 warriors. They are anxious after every kind of property carried among them for barter, and this is supposed their chief inducement for attacking vessels, when they can do so with a probability of accomplishing their object.– They have no knowledge of the use of muskets, and have none among them except a few at Port Anna Maria. A gentleman, at this time in Sydney, who resided among them about fifteen years ago in a Missionary capacity, describes them as a people constantly employing their thoughts on plunder, and devising schemes for taking advantage of strangers. Their population is very numerous; which he remarked to some of them, to whom he gave a description of Otaheite, observing at the same time, that its in habitants were less numerous:– Can't we go and take them?- What is there to hinder us? was immediately demanded. This anecdote we notice as a specimen of their natural inclination to hostility, in which, all accounts respecting them correspond. cannibalism;Pacific Islanders
