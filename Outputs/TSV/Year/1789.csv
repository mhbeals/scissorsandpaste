        ID4Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17890713informOur latest accounts from the West Indies say, that no supply from the islands, either of wheat or flour, can possibly be obtained from the American states in consequence of the great bounties given by his Most Christian Majesty on these articles. Our charity, therefore, if we have any of these articles to spare, must be first extended to our own Colonies ; and we cannot be surprised, particularly when we consider the present price of bread at home, that no assistance can be given at present, either to the French or Dutch. The crops in the island of Jamaica promise a most plentiful harvest, except to the eastward, which ahs generally been considered as the most productive part. By the Westmoreland, just arrived from Jamaica, we learn that the slaves have become mutinous to an alarming degree, ever since they were made acquainted with the intended abolition of the Slave Trade. slavery;international trade;agriculture
        ID5Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17890720informExtract of a letter from Quebec, June 6. We are dreadfully alarmed at present on account of the great scarcity of flour throughout the province. Common flour sold this morning in the market at six dollars, per cwt. bran from 7s. 6d. to 6s. oats 3s. per bushel, and pease 20d. per bushel. There has been an account taken of the quantity of flour and wheat in this city, and liberties, by order of the Governor and Council, and we find there is not more than will serve as ten days. They ar much worse off in the district of Montreal than we are here: We have sent them frequent supplies. Wheat which was found too bad to be shipped last year at three livres, now sells at two dollars. One Merchant will make upwards of fifteen hundred pounds by this job. Government, for the relief of the poor, have caused to be issued, by the contractor here, rise at 3 d. per lb. no one to get more than a dollar's worth at a time. The day before yesterday there was delivered above a hundred pounds worth in this way. In consequence of letters by last Thursday's post from Montreal, two thousand bushels of damaged wheat were shipped yesterday for that market. We have not had a grain of flour from England or the States, though we hear of a cargo from New York, for Montreal. The vessel was to call at New Brunswick ; and it is more than probably, that people there, being in great want themselves, have detained her. The Government have done now what they should have done five or six months ago, and then we should not be in this starving condition ; that is, we are to have a proclamation to permit the importation of grain and flour from the States. My servant is just come home from the baker's, where I had sent him for half a dollar's worth of bread. After watching for two hours, till the bread came out of the overn, he could get but eighteen-pennyworth ; three small loaves, indeed, weighing only two pounds each. Thirty-five shillings have been paid for ship biscuit. The Lord knows what will become of us–except Government will distribute some of the flour that is come for the troops, in the Queen. Mr. Davidson, one of the Council, assured us on Thursday last, there was not wheat and flour in the country for five weeks. He has taken a great deal of pains to be well informed on the subjuct; and to him are we indebted for the proclamation to allow the importation from the States. He stood forth alone, and offered, at his own expence, to get an account taken of the quantities of wheat and flour in the town and liberties of Quebec, and insisted on its being taken into consideration. agriculture;prices;international trade

No less than 300 ton of them were contracted for by Congress in the year 1787, to be coined at the rate of 50 ton per annum ; the contracters were also bound down to make them all of the famous Jersey copper. They are a little larger than the British halfpence. No British copper no passes in the United States;–silver and gold coins of all nations, however, pass cur rent.

        ID7Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17890720informExtract of a letter from a Gentleman in Bermuda to his friend in Norfolk, Virginia, dated April 2. By Captain Gilbert, the bearer of this you will learn our distress for want of provi - sions: There has not been in the whole island one bushel of corn for sale for 16 days past. Capt. George, from Baltimore, brought in ???days ago two bushels of corn, which sold immeddiately at 6s. 8d. per bushel; he also brought in 360 barrels of flour, common and superfine, which sold at eight and nine dollars per barrel. No vessel has arrived here with provisions since Capt. George; and no vessel belonging to the island is expected to relieve us. A great number of poor people have been for ten days past obliged to live on the greens of the field. Governor Hamilton, by advice of his counsel, has opened the port of Bermuda to all foreign vessels whatever, for thirty days, to be computed from the 30th day of March, laden with bread, corn; or flour. He also allows, for three months, the importation of salted provisions from any foreign port whatever, in vessels belonging to these islands. IT is said, what if any foreign vessel should come here after the time permited by proclamation, they will be allowed to dispose of their cargo, if they can prove they set out with an intent to come here. If any vessels be ready to sail from Norfolk, with provisions, advise them to call at Bermuda. agriculture;international trade
        ID8Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17890706informTHE following extract from a late publication, entitled, A State of the present Government of the Province of Quebec, will give the public some idea of the Canada Bill, which has been so much talked of an procrastinated so long, and at present pending in Parliament. The work we understand to be the production of Adam Lymburner, Esq; set over by the province to negotiate this afair. It is remarkable,withhis former publication, for its strong nervous elocution and perspicuity of reasoning. Liberty is congenial to the feelings of all mankind. The security which flows from a free constitution, to both political and civil liberty, contributes greatly towards bringing forth the powers of the human mind, and the encouragement of the industry of people ; but no constitution can be called free where the people are not allowed to participate of the legislative authority by their representatives : This is the great criterion of freedom; and it is extremely natural for all British subjects, as they know the value of it, to struggle for such a valuable right. Great Britain has constantly acknoledged this prin ciple in the constitution she has granted to all her Colonies; and by that means has rendered them more flourishing and prosperous than those of o ther nations. Although the inhabitants of the province of Quebec have, from the general tendency of the British government to a mild administration, enjoyed a certain degree of civil liberty; yet they have been, from the peculiar nature of the system of their government, entirely deprived of all political liberty. A more full enjoyment of these essential privileges has been the prayer of their petitions, and of those now be fore the House of commons. The objects prayed for may be reduced to the following heads:– 1. An elective house of assembly or representatives of the people. 2. That the members of the legislative council receive no salaries as counsellors. 3. That the habeas corpus act, and the other laws of England relating to personal liberty,be made a part of the constitution. 4. That trial by jury in civil causes be likewise made part of the constitution, and that nine out of twelve may return a verdict. 5. That the ancient laws and customs of Canada, relative to landed property, marriage settlements, inheritance, and dowers, be continued in force in the districts or international trade
        ID9Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17890821entertainCurious Anecdote.–A few days ago a stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly, Treasurer of the East India Company, and desired to speak to him in private ; when the were retired, the stranger said to Mr. Sibbly, I am lately returned from India, I have smuggled goods to the amount of about 120l. What duty have I to pay upon them? Mr. Sibbly smiled, and told him, That he could receive no such money without the Chairman's permission. Pray then (said the stranger) speak to him of it as soon as possible. I am resolved to pay whatever the duty is. The Company pays for the exclusive privilege of bringing India goods to Europe; the man that deprives them of any part of the advantages they hope to reap from it, cannot, in my opinion, look upon himself as a strictly honest man. Since the stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly, the Chairman had not had time to give him an answer ; the stranger notwithstanding, gave him a letter, including a Bank note of 30l. The sum Mr. Sibbly told him he should pay, if he paid any thing. international trade
        ID10Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17890821informExtract of a letter from India, by the Dublin East Indiaman, to Mr. William Jones We left Patia Dec. 15, 1789, and went to Decca, and arrived there after a passage of 16 days. Just as we arrived there was a famine, and it was really a shocking sight to behold; you could not move out of your house but the corpses lay in your way, and the wild dogs and jackalls were eating them at noon-day. The Hindoos never bury their dead, but burn them to ashes, if they can afford it; if not, throw them into the river. I have lately seen a man brought to the river side, and laid down at lowwater mark before he was dead ; and when the the tide flowed, it carried him off. If a man, woman, or child, dies at night, the corpse is eaten by the morning. This I have been an eye witness of ; for as I always rode out on horseback every morning, I had an opportunity of seeing more than those that did not. In the course of six months I became so much used to it, that I took no notice of it. I was there when a dreadful conflagration took place, and burnt upwards of seven miles without intermission, and many souls perished. Now consider, first, an inundation; second, a famine; and third, a conflagration. How much the place must be distressed, I leave you to think. I left Decca the 1st of December last, and arrived at Calcutta, after a passage through the Sunderburns (in 17 days), hearty and well, thank God. national characteristics;fire
        ID11Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17890824persuadeThe old system of sending men of rank to govern Jamaica, seems to be revived, and laudably too. This island is the most important possession we hold in the West Indies, and is well entitled to any mark of distinction which the parent country can bestow upon it. The salary and emoluments annexed to the government of Jamaica, render it the most valuable of any in the King's gift, except that of Ireland. Soon after the Restoration, O'Brian, third Earl of Inchiquin, was appointed Governor of Jamaica, and died in his Government. Henry Bentinck, first Duke of Portland, was made Governor of this island in the reign of George I. His Grace died at Spanish Town, July 4th, 1736, in the 45th year of his age. The death of these two Noblemen in their government, gave so bad an impression of the climate of Jamaica, and the insalubrity of its air, that few persons of rank and fortune have been ambitious of becoming governors of it, notwith standing the brilliancy of the appointments an nexd to the situation. colonial government
        ID12Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17890824informA letter from the Bay of Honduras, dated May 26, says, The Spaniards, who pay an annual visit to this settlement, to prevent en croachments, are destroying all the cultivated spots on shore, alleging that the settlers are prohibited by the convention from cultivation of any kind. This will prove a temporary misfortune to the woodcutters, by depriving them of the principal means of subsisting their negroes, and might be productive of mischief, were it not that the British Superintendant, Colonel Despar, with the assistance of the Calypso sloop of war, keeps the woodcutters in order. This may rise the price of mahogany at home, and certainly will raise provisions here. border dispute;slavery;timber trade
        ID13Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17890828informExtract of a letter form Philadelphia, dated 25th May, 1789. I have travelled through several of the States and see no appearance of the poverty which you hear so much boast of in Britain–every where I meet rather with extravagance. Indeed they procure too easily to be frugal in their out-givings. All the manufactured goods imported from Europe are from Britain, and they cannot have goods equal in quality and price from any other place. I think I never say so many children as are in this country, every town, village, and farm-house, are full of them.–The people of this country increase like rabbits: It is supposed they double their numbers every fifteen years; but I should think they do it in a shorter period.–What a grand prospect for the sale of British goods, for when so many hundreds of millions of acres of land lye idle to be granted or purchased at a small price, the people of this country never will manufacture ; At present wages are high, and 1000 acres of land in the back settlements may be purchased for as many pence?. national characteristics;settlement description;wages

        ID18Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17890921persuadeA short DESCRIPTION of, and REMARKS upon a new State called THE WESTERN TERRITORY, being one of four settled by the Americans since 1774. T HAT no nation can serve the Americans with goods equal in quality and price to Britain, is wha the whole world knows, and from experience the most obstinate rebel American dare not deny: It is with pleasure, therefore, we inform our readers, that the United States are paying more attention to agriculture than to manufactures–They have already laid out four new States since the beginning of their rebellion, viz. Vermont, Kentucky, Indiana, and The Western Territory. About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wilderness; they only began to settle it about the year 1774. Kentucky, ten years ago lay in forest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid has been the population, that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants, already, in each of these states. The State of Indiana was only laid off this present year in 1789, and contains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From a description of these four States, published in America in May last, we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of them, called The Western Territory ; and it must rerejoice the heart of every Briton to read it, and think, that the settling of these countries, though the Americans double their numbers every 15 or 20 years, will long keep them from manufacturing, and is every day opening a field for new customers to Great Britain; for who will work as a tradesman, even though wages are very high, when he can, for twenty pounds, purchase a thousand acres of land, that being the present price fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of America.–Desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect, that new channels of commerce will be opened, and the inland parts of the Continent will require an increasing supply.–British manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that Continent, and by means of a most extraordinary inland navigation, will be diffused through a country more fertile, more extensive, than all the Thirteen United States. The Western Territory Is the name given to this new State by Congress. It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi river –north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania? south and south-east by the Ohio river; contains, according to Mr. Hutchins, Geographer General to the Congress, 411,000 square miles, equal to two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres, from which he deducts forth-three millions of acres for water; there will then remain two hundred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the fed–ral government, which is to be sold for the discharge of the debt owing to the United States. But a very small proportion of these lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and disposed of by Congress*. On the lands which have been purchased by Congress from the Indians two settlements are already commenced–one at Marietta, the other at Miami. This State was only laid out by Congress in the end of the year 1787, and already contains above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are the Mississippi, Ohio, Muskingham, Hockhocking, Sioto, Miami, Wobash,&c–Coal and iron mines, and salt pits, abound in this State; the soil is excellent?as rich as can be imagined, and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little or no labour. It is exceedingly healthy, pleasant, and commodious–the most fertile spot of earth known to the Europeans or Americans–exceeding the soil of any of the United States. The timber is tall, and in great variety?Streams for mills abound here. Wheat, indigo, hemp, and cotton, thrive well. Many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties, and fulfill the description of travellers, who call it the garden of the world. It is here probably also that the center of a great empire will be fixed in some future period. It is the most centrical place for Congress to accommodate themselves at. No country is better stocked with wild game of every kind; herds of deers, elks, bears, &c fill the extensive meadows of thie country?turkies, geese, swans, and partridges, &c. are innumerable. The rivers are excellently stored with fish, and almost all navigable for small sloops. In the ordinance published by Congress for the government of this territory, they are to be allowed an Assembly when their number amounts to 30,000 persons; and when they acquire a certain degree of population they are to have representatives in Congress; and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into States. Rejoice, O Britons! that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you, and you only! * No more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives, for which Congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum. Native Americans;international trade;agriculture;settlement description

        ID20Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17891009inform[ Continued from our last.] Carlisle, July 29. O N Saturday last between three and four o'clock, P. M. happened the most violent hurricane pest, or thunder storm (for we are at a lost to determine its proper name) that was ever known in this borough or its vicinity. We can conceive of nothing but an earthquake, that could be attended with more alarming circumstances. The cloud from the west, or rather a number of clouds of a lowering aspect, furiously agitated, broken, and seemingly ready to fall– attracted the attention, and prepared the mind in some measure for what was to follow. The lightening appeared to those who were at a distance, remarkably red, and seemed to flash from the cloud to the earth and back again, in quick succession or some time, as to appear one sheet of flame. This might have had a great effect on the air, at some miles distance from town, to set it in rapid motion, especially when pressed down by a heavy cloud suddenly falling towards the earth. A very considerable quantity of hail fell; and the rain was so abundant that it seemed as thrown from buckets, and being carried along and dashed against every opposing object by a most impetuous wind, darkened the air in such a manner, that all surrounding objects seemed lost in night. The storm threatened to lay the whole town in ruins, with such irresistible force did the column of air move on: happily however, the damages were much less than apprehended. The The new brick house belonging to the Rev. Dr. Davidson, being an an elevated spot near the west end of the town, and lying directly in the line of march of this powerful column, was the first sufferer; all the parts of the building above the square were suddenly borne off, and a great part of the roof was carried over Mr. Paton's house, which stood at a small distance on the east, striking it forcibly, and injuring it greatly in its ways, and fell on the adjoining lot. Mr. Paton's house is left in much the same condition as the Doctor's. After injruing some smaller buildings in its course to the eastward, the next elevated object to which it pointed its fury, was the presbyterian church in the certain of town–a building of uncommon solidity, calculated, it was thought, to stand for ages, admist all the war of the elements. About a fourth part, however of the roof of the north side was carried off, with the weighty cornice, and thrown to the ground at some hundred yards distance on the east side of the open square which is in the centre of this borough. After leaving the town it beat its course to the public buildings, and greatly injured that range nearest the town. Many fences in the neighbourhood, which were in the line of its direction, were also thrown down; but how far it extended, or what damages the farmers may have sustained we have not yet learned. Let it, however, not be forgotten, that dreadful as the scene was, through the good providence of God, not a single life was lost or any personal injury, worth mentioning, received, and the buildings, it is hoped, will soon be restored to as good a state as they were in before. weather

Neither mildew nor fly has affected the wheat; the grain is heavy, and full, and in large quantities. The other grains are likewise plentiful, and of an excellent quality. Such distinguished favours call for the gratitude of the inhabitants of the United Sates, to the great Author of Nature; especially when these blessings of nature are connected in the same year with deliverance from anarchy, and with the establishment of a wise, free, and just government. agriculture

Gorham and Phelps–That they were met by Mr. Phelps and the principal inhabitants of Conadoque, four miles from that place, and conducted into town –That they were highly gratified with the treatment they received, and with the manner in which they had disposed of their lands.–The gentleman further informs, that there is now about 3000 inhabitants in the above county, and that the land is of a good quality. Native Americans

The change which then took place was very sudden and unhealthy. Upwards of twenty persons fell unhappy [?]ic tions to the heat last week; and it is said, that as many of them died by over labouring as by drinking cold water, Raw rum has been found exceedingly pernicious in this extreme heat; –man who was seen intoxicated but a few momments before, suddenly fell on one of those days –and the cry was– Poor fellow! he has certainly drank too much cold water! Cold water has however been instantaneously fatal in se - veral instances. [ To be concluded in our next.] weather;health
        ID25Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17891120informWe have been favoured by a friend with the following extract of a letter from Grenada, by the last West India Packet. A Mr. C– has just arrive here from Martinico, where he left the white inhabitants in arms. The negroes there had conceived an idea, that the Parliament of England had set the English negroes free ; where upon those on several of the most considerable estates assembled together to the amount of 4000, and retired to the mountains, declaring, they would no longer be slaves ; saying, that they had as good a right to be free, as the negroes in the English islands. What has been the event is unknown ; but some reports say that they had arms, and had resisted the military and the militia ; and that 400 had been taken and condemned to die. It is a little singular that such an alarming spirit of discontent should first make its appearance among the French negroes, if they are (as has been assented by several writers) so much more civilized, so much better treated, than those of the English islands. God knows what bloodshed may soon follow, from the mistaken humanity of some well meaning, but ill informed leaders among you. slavery;slave insurrections

In the evening of their arrival, before they had taken their station as a guard, a number of Indians rushed into Mr. Chenoweth's house, killed two of the soldiers, and three of Mr. Chenoweth's children, and tomahawked and scalped his wife, leaving her on the floor for dead– Mr. Chenoweth, (who had his arm broke by the savages) with the rest of the men, made their escape.–There was one of Mr. Chenoweth's children sick, in a chamber, and, it is reported, she never heard any thing of the dreadful massacre; but, next morning, crawling down stairs, she was inexpressibly shocked at the sight of a beloved parent almost breathless–Mr. Chenoweth returned next day to his house, and carried his wife to a neighbouring plantation, where they are both likely to recover, and, what is remarkable, she wants to return to her own house.–The savages have been very troublesome in this neighbourhood. –A small company are gone to White River, to extirpate 80 or 90 Indians, who, as spies have informed, have upwards of 300 horses, &c. at that place. Native Americans

        ID31Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17891127persuadeWhat mighty contests rise from trivial things; That the present Revolution in France is a consequence of the Revolution in America, cannot admit of a doubt. The American Revolution originated in Adams, a very insignificant Bostonian. Not that this Adams had the least expectation of American independence, when he fomented the opposition to the stamp-act; indeed no human wisdom could possibly have foreseen the subsequent folly and imprudence of the British administration and its obsequious Parliament. An Administration so totally destitute of common sense, so totally ignorant of every princple of sound policy, no nation ever beheld. Adams had the sagacity to avail himself of such despicable policies.–Fortunately for the American cause, the Generals that were sent from England were of congenial abilities with the Minister, and the Americans themselves were surprised at the facility with which they acquired their independence. –Yet all the blunders of the British administration, and the miserable conduct of the British Generals, would hardly have been sufficient to emancipate America, notwithstanding her extreme weakeness, without the assistance of France; and this assistance depended entirely on Dr. Franklin being driven to Paris by the fatal-philippic of a certain great lawyer. Such, therefore, is the chain of concurrent circumstances that hath overturned the French monarch. If the British minister had possessed common sagacity–if he could have distinguished a general from a corporal; if Franklin had been treated with common civility, America would have remained a British colony, and France an absolute monarch, for ages yet to come. revolution
        ID32Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17891211informMr. Ephraim Daniel, of Baker's-row, Mileend, received the following letter from a friend in Holland last week: Sir, your friend L–y, who is just come here from the East Indies, desires me to inform you, that your unfortunate relation who left you with the transports for Botany Bay, was well in February last. He has settled at Port Jackson, and has leave to teach the children of some of your nation to read and write in your own way. The place is much improved since you ahve had any letters form it, as there was no person without a habitation, and being in some order, when he left it. Except wearing apparel, very little is wanting but business ; but you may thank the Dutch at Batavia for it, as they have brought several useful things there. The last crops of corn, and the garden grounds, were in very good condition : and what makes the settlement more convenient, one of the people who came in the first fleet makes all forts of earthn ware for use and ornament, as the clay is equally good as that of Delft or elsewhere.

The plot was not discovered till five o'clock in the evening, when a negro belonging to an old lady, stung with remorse on thinking that he must murder the woman who brought him up form a child, disclosed it to her. The Troops being thereupon assembled, 40 of the negroes were taken, armed with a hanger and a long knife, the insturments which were in a few hours to have put a period to the existence of upwards of 5000 people. All the inhabitants have been under arms ever since, as they are afraid the negroes will attemp to release the 40 who are in gaol. slavery;slave insurrections

To my utter astonishment, my rustic landlord did not take in own newspaper; so there was I, stuck down, with my friend in the country–knowing no more of what passed in town than if I had been in Lapland. Intending every day should be my last, I went on without ordering your, or any other paper, till two months had passed away, at which period I returned to town. And there, Sir, I was quite a new man, and just as if I had dropped down from the clouds. Every day I heard people talking of occurrences of which I knew nothing : Revolutions in France by Fishwomen ; and battles in Flanders, against the Emperor, who I thought was fighting against the Turks. But even this was not the most distressing–for one day meeting a friend, I inquired very cordially after his wife, who I found a few days afterwards, had eloped just before with another gentleman ; and meeting with a lady, I inquired kindly for her sister, who I found had departed to the other world a fortnight before. On this account I never will stir again out of the world unless your paper goes along with me. I hold a newspaper to be a kind of viaticum with which every man should be provided, and which become the more necessary the further we remove from town It. is the only way to keep pace with what is going on every day in the fashionable or literary world–and to prevent talking about dead friends, or wives that have absconded. In short, Sir, a newspaper is my creed –and never will I again travel without my faith along with me : having fully experienced the unpleasantness of being sent back into the world as ignorant as if I had been born again– I hereby give notice – That if an hottentot friend of mine invites me, who does not take in your paper or some other– I will not visit him.

        ID42Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17891214informAccount of a singular Sect called Shaking QuakERS in America. I N the United States of America there are some Jews, and various denomications of Christians, –as Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Baptists, Quakers, Dunkers, Moravians, Deists, Methodists, Newlights, Sandimanians, Universalists, and Shaking Quakers; all of whom are allowed to perform religious worship accoridng to the dictates of their consciences. The Shaking Quakers are a new sects, that sprang up about the year 1769 : an old woman called the Elect Lady, with twelve disciples, all of which were said to be Europeans, were the founders of this new mode of worship ; they drew thousands of people after them, who pretended they were visited with power from on high to work miracles, heal the sick, raise the dead, cast out devils, and speak in unknown languages. This Lady risided in the north-westerly part of the State of New York, where she began to instil her tenets into some of the people there:– afterwards she rambled from place to place, promulgating her religion, and gaining proselytes in New England, and elsewhere:–she engrossed the kingdom of heaven to herself and followers, to the seculsion of all others. She pretended her mission was immediately from heaven;–that she travelled in pain for her elect, –could speak in seventry-two unknown languages, in which she conversed with those that had departed this life,–that there had not been a true church upon earth since the days of the Apostles, until her's was erected,–that both the living and the dead must be saved, in, by, and through her –must confess their sins unto her, and procure her parson, or they could not be saved;–that that she gathered her church from both earth and hell, as every person that had died since the time of the Apostles, until her church was set up, was damned, and that they were ocntinually making intercession to her for salvation, which was the occasion of her talking to them in those unknown tongues. Those that entered into her church were obliged to confess their sins, and deliver up their jewels, rings, necklaces, buckles, watches, &c. to be disposed of as she thought fit. It has been reported that some of these confessions proved very beneficial; for some of her church members owned they had stolen things that had been laid to innocent persons. When these people carry on their worship, they pretend to praise the Lord by singing, dancing, jumping, turning round, falling down, tumbling, &c. and in the mean time some will be trembling, groaning, sighing, and sobbing: whilst others are preaching, praying, exhorting, &c. others will be clapping their hands, shouting, hallowing, screaming, and making such a hideous noise, that it may be heard at a great distance, and will often affrighten the spectators. They often dance three hours without intermission, and when any of them are tired of praising the Lord that way, they are whipped by others, to make the worship go on briskly. They dance till they are much emaciated ; the young women grow pale, appear like ghosts or apparitions, or like deserters from a church-yard, –if I may use the sailor's phrase. They make no use of the Eucharist, or of water baptism in their churchs; are averse to wars, fighting, and swearing ; they use the plain language, and cry– yea, and nay, instead of yes and no : but the other Quakers do not approve of all their tenets. At particular times they labour very hard at their respective occupations, and are very careful that no time is spent in idleness. They pretend they hold a correspondence with the saints and angels, and that they frequently see and converse with the spirits of their departed friends. Many of them refuse to be with their wives, because they suppose they are part of the hundred and forty and four thousand mentioned in the Revelations that were redeemed from the earth, and were not defiled with women. They hold, that they have already been made partakers of the first resurrection, and that on them the second death will have no power. They do not allows the instrumental music in their churches, because they suppose it was ceremonial, and is abolished;–but pretend that they carry on their worship by the immediate power and influence of the Holy Ghost, and that they have scripture warrents for their practice, a[?]– Sing unto God,–Praise the Lord in the dance; –O clap your hands, all ye people;–Shout on to God;–Make a joyful noise;–Fall down before the Lords,&c. religion

        ID45Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17891218informMartinique, Oct. 6. The disturbances in this island are so far from having abated, that they seem daily to gain additional force. The French General, after the and endeavoured to bring over a part of the military to his side, against the people : He began with subalterns, several of whom took a certain oath of attachment which he administered to them ; but when he came to the Major, that officer declined, saying he had already engaged himself on the side of the people. Incensed at this reply, he reviled him in very opprobrious terms, and at last laid his cane upon him ! Frustrated in his attempts upon the infantry, he made his next application to the regiment of artillery, but with as little success. They informed him, that themselves and Culverins were stationed there for the protection of the people, and for them only should be used. Driven to the last shift, his distress suggested the sorry expedient of having recourse to the people of colour, who here form a considerable corps. By a small dose of flattery these people, so readily to be caught by a little seeming attention, promised to stand by him ; and did so, as long as they usually stand firm to any thing–that is, till their fears for their own persons became an object of more weighty concern–they then abandoned him. The humiliating familiarities to which he descended to this motley rabble, were truly disgusting. He embraced them; called them his enfans and cher amis, and practised all the dirty condescensions, which those only who are conversant in the praise-worthy art of cajoling, can form any conception of. The effect of this conduct was, as might be expected, insolence–one of this banditti presumed to strike a grenadier–this incensed both the military and the peopl–the consequence was, their doughty leader was laid hold of, when his trusty defenders left him to his fate. He wa sput into confinement, and had the pleasure of beholding from the windows of his prison, him whom he had inspired with the insolent temerity to strike White, suspended on a gibbet. The inhabitants of St. Pierre then assembled to confer on the measures to be taken on this occasion, when ten deputies were chosen to bring the deposed Commander to that part of the island for trial, and twelve Judges were chosen to preside at that very important tribunal. Thus stood matters on Thursday last, at which time a rumour prevailed that the Marquis de Bouillee had suffered death by the extraordinary and ingenious method of being put between two planks and severed in pieces by a cross-cut saw. military;revolution
        ID46Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17891218informExtract of a letter from Philadelphia, Aug. 23. Congress is still sitting at New York, and from the multiplicity of business before them, there is no likelihood of the session's soon closing. We are curious to know what foreigners will say of our new commercial arrangements. Among ourselves there is but one opinion, and that is faavourable. o our own vessels, a preference is undoubtedly due; and among foreign vessels and merchandise, there is no discrimination in our import and tonnage acts, every nation being on the same footing. With respect to the duties themselves, they could not be laid lower, considering the demand of supplies, which the Committee appointed to give in an estimate state at upwards of eight millions of dollars. Accustomed to disappointment in hopes of improvement in politics and commerce, we feel a reluctance to entertaining very sanguine wishes. Yet appearances encourage the expecttion of the f–deral government's acting with the energy and effect that will give it respectability. The prejudices and animosities created by the late contest are gradually dying away ; and to the idleness and dissipation flowing from the same source, industry has in a great degree succeeded. A progress has also been made in manufactures of various kinds that was not expected ; and the persevering in them affords a strong presumption of those concerned deriving advantage. Throughout the union, the public opinion on matters of government has of late experienced rapid changes. Vice President Adams, in his highly esteemed work, has fully demonstrated the absurdity of democracy, and the superior excellence of a mix form, such as that of Britain. His deductions from premises admitted as just, have abated much of the popular aversion to monarchy ; and as every thing matures quickly in our transatlantic soil, it would not surprise many, were United America to have a sovereign earin the next century. In no one instance has our new admnistration given general satisfaction, more than in their conduct towards the Indians. The interests of those unfortunate people will be studiously attended to ; and they will be effectually protected against the lawless violence of the individuals or States, who wished to wrest their lands from them. This determination is dictated by policy as well humanity ; for it is now become the interest of the States to check, by every means short of violence, the erratic disposition of their citizens, who, when removed to the wilds beyond the mountains, cannot be regarded as of any value, in a political view. Native Americans;colonial politics

        ID48Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17891218persuadeThe Minister is now said to be employed in drawing up two plans, which will give rise to very warm debates in Parliament : one is for settling a commercial arrangement between Great Britain and Ireland ; the other for giving a constitution to Canada. In feeling the former, the Minister will have to contend with strong commercial prejudices; in the latter, he will have to encounter religious principles. The British settlers in Canada are comparatively few in number. The great bulk of the Canadians are the descendants of French, and are Roman Catholics. The former are Protestants. Fleaury in france, and Walpole in England, were not fonder of peace than Mr. Pitt. Conquests may be made by war, but consequence and wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system, if the first commercial nation in the world. Besides these considerations, the grand secret has been discovered since the present Minister came into power, that the best riddance England ever had, was of her American Colonies ; because by this means, she becomes thoroughly collected at home, to oppose every foreign power, without the expence and blood of supporting the Americans, at the same time that they cannot do without BRitish manufactures in one line or another. Thus, they are under the necessity of protecting themselves, at the same time, that, like the rest of Europe, they are obliged to resort to our superior mercantile market. Application has been lately made to the Lords of the Treasury for an order on the Bank to issue some of the new silver coin, in aid of the present want of silver for circulation, the scarcity of which is much felt by retail traders in particular. international trade;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States;religion

At Port au Prince both the Governor and Intendant have rendered themselves completely odious, by vain attempts to counteract an impulse that is irresistible. The effigy of Mons. Marbois, the latter, has been hung and burnt; the people loudly insist that both shall immediately quit the colony, and their departure is hourly expected.

        ID50Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17891221persuadeThe following philosophical facts lead us to presume that the winter now setting in, will prove a mild one : It has been constantly remarked, that when this season commences early, and with severity, in Newfoundland, and the more northern part of North America, it becomes extremely rigorous, and of a proportionate continuance there. When, in the above climate, the winters have been severe, they have invariably been mild with us, and vice versa. Now, the ships which sailed from Newfoundland the beginning of October last, saw the hills already covered with snow. There is still another argument in favour of a mild winter with us. Previously to the setting in of a severe one, nature, in her bounty, has been always observed to have provided an uncommon store of wild briar fruits, as a nourishment to the smaller birds, who would otherwise perish, a vast carpet of snow spreading itself over the ground, so as to prevent their coming at the worms, &c. on which they are accustomed to feed. The present season, the store of these wild fruits is extremely moderate. weather

        ID54Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17891204informExtract of a letter from Portsmouth, Nov. 23. The convicts already arrived at this port from Newfoundland, are near fourscore in number; a few others are expected. These unhappy wretches are almost destitute of every sort of covering, and some of them are labouring under sickness and infirmity. Their story is accurateas follows: About the middle of last June, this miserable class of beings, to the amount of 102 men and boys, and twelve women, all of whom were convicts, were embarked at Dublin, on board the Duke of Leinster transport, the owners of which, who are Dublin merchants, contracted with the Government of Ireland for carrying the convicts to the North American States. After the ship had been at sea five weeks, part of which was foul weather, the provision is said to have fallen short ; the master of the transport, Capt. Harrison, accordingly stood in for Newfoundland and lay-to till night; when he disembarked at Bull's Bay, and a little distance from it, with as much secrecy as possible, his desperate freight. To prevent this proceeding being too early early known, he landed with them provision for the immediate supply of their wants, and bore away with a press of sail. The hungry victims lived for three days in a state of warfare, quarrelling about their food ; the strongest beat the weak, and over a cask of rank butter or beef, there was for a time as severe fighting as if a kingdom had been at stake. They reached the town of St. John's on the 20th of July ; and exhibited the most appaling procession ever seen in that country : the inhabitants had immediate councils; and the military and navy co-operating, a place of security was fixed upon at a distance from the town, and they were lodged ; here under a guard. Here the Irish howl was nightly sung in full chorus, and the centinels were frequently frighted with the noise while on their posts. A battle or two every half hour kept them festive all day; and when the provision supplied to them by the inhabitants was lessening, they broke away, and laid hold of every thing that was eatable, without enquiring whether it had an owner. Some of these poor wretches were anxious to be received into the service of the inhabitants and probably might have reformed, if so fostered. But all of them have a claim to the charity of this country for that supply of raiment which is necessary to guard them against the inclement weather. transportation

        ID395Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17890921informA short Description of, and Remarks upon a new State called The Western Territory, being one of four settled by the Americans since 1774. THAT no nation can serve the Americans with good equal in quality and price to Britain, is what the whole world knows, and from experience the most obstinate rebel American dare not deny: It is with pleasure, therefore, we inform our readers, that the United States are paying more attention to agriculture than to manufactures–They have already laid out four new States since the beginning of their rebellion, viz. Vermont, Kentucky, Indiana, and The Western Territory. About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wilderness; they only began to settle it about the year 1774. Kentucky, ten years ago, lay in forest wild, it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid has been the population, that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants, already, in each of these States. The State of Indiana was only laid off this present year 1789, and contains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From a description of these four States, published in American in May last, we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of them, called The Western Territory; and it must rerejoiced the heart of every Briton to read it, and think, that the settling of these countries, though the Americans double their numbers every 15 or 20 years, will long keep them from manufacturing, and is every day opening a field for new customers to Great Britain; for who will work as a tradesman, even though wages are very high, when he can, for twenty pounds, purchase a thousand acres of land, that being the present price fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of America.–Desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect, that new channels of commerce will be opened, and the inland parts of the Continent will require an incresing supply.–British manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that Continent, and by means of a most extraordinary inland navigation, will be diffused through a country more fertile, more susceptible of population, and six time more extensive, than all the Thirteen United States. The Western Territory Is the name given to this new State by Congress. It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi riverlb/>–north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania– south and south-east by the Ohio reiver; contains, according to Mr. Hutchins, Geographer General to the Congress, 411,000 square miles, equal to two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres, from which he deducts forty-three millions of acres for water; there will then remain two hunred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the foederal government, which is to be sold for the discharthe debt owing to the United States. But a very small proportion of theselands is yet purchased of the native Indians and disposed of by Congress*. On the lands which have been purchased by Congress from the Indians two settlements and already commenced*#x2013;one at Marietta, the other at Miami. This State was only laid out by Congress in the end of the year 1787, and already contains about 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are the Mississippi, Ohio, Muskingham, Hockhocking, Sioto, Miami, Wobash, &c.–Coal and iron mines, and salt pits, abound in this State; the soil is excellent–as rich as can be imagined, and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little or no labour. It is exceeding healthy, pleasant, and commodious–the most fertile sport of earth known to the Europeans or Americans–exceeding the soil of any of the United States. The timber is tall, and in great variety.–Streams for mills abound here. Wheat, indigo, hemp, and cotton, thrive well. Many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties, and justify the descrpition of travellers, who call it the *garden of of a great empire will be fixed in some future pethe world*. It is here probably also that the centre riod. It is the most centrical place for Congress to accomodate themselves at. No country is better stocked with wild game of every kind; herds of deers, elks, bear, &c. fill the extensive meadows of this country–turkies, geese, swans, and partridges, &c. are innumerable. The rivers are excellently stored with fish, and almost all navigable for small sloops. In the ordinance published by Congress for the government of this territory, they are to be allowed an Assembly when their number amounts to 30,000 persons' and when they acquire a certain degree of population they are to have representatives in Congress; and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into States. Rejoice, O Britons! that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you, and you *only* *No more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives, for which Congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum. Native Americans;colonial government;demographics
