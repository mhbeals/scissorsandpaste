        ID87Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17910523informQUEBEC, December 2, 1790 Yesterday's post from Montreal, conveyed letters to several gentlemen in town, all corroboratiing the following extract. SIR, I have to inform you by several letters received here on Saturday from Detroit, we are informed the Americans, under General Sinclair, had been twice defeated, about the 19th ult. with the loss of from 500 to 600 men, by the Indians The Indians first attacked a body of 300 horse which they had drawn into a snare, and cut the whole of them off. In a second engagement, they were likewise victorious, having nearly killed as many. On account of which, Sinclair thought proper to retreat; and the last accounts state the Indians having divided themselves into small parties, had so harrassed him, that he was obliged to leave the wounded in the field–Sinclair lost his artillery, a cohorn, and grass-hopper. It is said the Indians are very much elated at their success, and that numbers were daily joining them, at their head quarters, about the Maimis towns– One Indian, it is said, killed 30 with his own hand. The Indians were extremely civil to the traders from Detriot, having assisted them, when they knew of the approach of the Americans, to remove their property to safety, except ammunition and arms. These are facts so well ascertained, that there does not remain the least doubt of them: They may be attended with very serious and important consequences to the province, as I dare say, all will be imputed to the British for supplying these Indians with arms and ammunition.– In short, I would not be surprized to hear of an American army raising, to attack this country. * The loss is here specified, but other letters differing in number, we shall only say, the estimate in general does not appear considerable. Native Americans
        ID318Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17910627informThe unsettled state of a great part of the Westtern Frontiers of America (if we can suppose that there are any determined frontiers when the settlers are making large and continual encroachments) must very much depreciate the sale of lands in those parts, notwithstanding the very small rates of purchase demanded for vast extents of ground, and the soil being remarkable fertile and productive. The ineffectual attempts of last summer to prevent the future depredations of the Miamis, and some other tribes of Indians, and the barbarities before and since committed on the setlers, must occasion other people to be very cautious of removing to places where they would hold their lives and property on a very precarious teure, unless the arms of the State prove remarkably successful in their future attacks. Native Americans
        ID319Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17910502informNassau, New England, March 12. The red bugs, which did so much injury to the cotton last year, have again made their appearance, but not in such numbers as was first expected. The hops in many States of America have been particularly productive. A letter from Great-Ogreechee, in Georgia, dated December 9th, says, since the completion of the treaty with the Creeks, all has been very quiet, unless we except some ill-natured state - bickerings and heart-burning amongst ourselves, chiefly occasioned by a few influential men, who find themselves great losers by a general act of common justice towards the Indians. These, however, we expect, will subside by degrees; notwithstanding the formidable combination in a certain part of the State. As to the Creeks, Siminoles, and other nations adjoining our Western frontier, nothing is clearer than that, so far from being injurious to us, they may henceforward be made useful to the real interests of this State, provided the faith of treaties be observed. They now show every disposition to copy our manners, arts, agriculture, and mode of living. agriculture;Native Americans
        ID320Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17910304informMr. Bowles, the Cherokee Chief, proposes to introduce the art of Printing amongst the Indians, with whom he resides; and, for this purpose, has engaged two persons to accompany him on his return, and has provided himself with all the implements of the art. The day fixed for their departure is the 20th of March The Indian companions of Mr. Bowles are two Creeks and two Cherokees. these nations, though contiguous to each other, and in strict union, differ as essentially as possible in language and manners. Both, however, entertain the most implacable animosity against the Spaniards, whose authority and dominions in South America they make no scruple of avowing they mean to try to diminish. Native Americans;Spanish Empire
        ID323Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17911108informExtract of a letter from a Gentleman in Muskingum to his Friend in the City of Norwich, (Connecticut,) dated Nov. 24, 1790. The prospect of peace from our frontiers, seems to me to be vanished for the present; the troops from this garrison have this morning returned, and the best account I can collect of the expedition is as follows: viz. the troops amounting to about 1200 militia, and about 300 regulars, after seventeen days march from Miami, reached the great Miami village, about 170 miles, without any molestation, except having a number of their pack-horse stole.–On their arrival they found the village deserted, and all the valuable builder a short tarry, they proceeded to neighings set on flames by the Indians. Afbouring villages, without molestation, and deftroyed five of them, and a quantity of corn, computed at fifteen thousand bushels, which they found buried in different places, and very large quantities of vegetables of every kind. The first opposition that was met with, a party of about 150 Kentucky militia, and thirty regular troops, all under the command of Col. Hardin, of Kentucky, were detached from the main body, lying in the great Miami village, to pursue the track of a party of Indians which had the day before been discovered. After a pursuit of about six miles, they came up with, and were attacked by surprise, by a body of Indians, who were concealed in the thickets on every side of a large plain; and on the first onset the militia, without exchanging a single fire, made a most precipitate retreat, and left the regular troops to stand the whole charge of the Indians; the conflict was short and bloody; the troops were soon overpowered by numbers, and all fell, except the two offiers and two or three privates, after defending themselves at their bayonet points with the greatest possible obstinacy. Ensign Hartshorn, of Franklin, was one of the four that escaped, and his escape appeared to depend on a more luckly circumstance of falling over a log in his retreat, and by that means screening himself from the eye of his pursuers, that from any other circumstance. Captain Armstrong, who commanded the party, likewise made his escape, by plunging himself into a pond or swamp, up to his neck, within two hundred yards of the field of action, where he remained the whole night, as a spectator of the horrid scene of the War Dance, performed over the dead and wounded bodies of the poor soldiers that had fallen the preceding day, where their shrieks, mixed with the horrid yells of the savages, rendered his situation shocking. After this, some few skirmishes succeeded, but nothing material, until the second capital action, which happened two days after the army left the Miami village. At ten miles distance from the town, the General ordered a halt, and detached from four to five hundred militia, and about sixty regular soldiers, commanded by Major Wylls, all under the command of Col. Harden, with orders to march back to the town. On their first entrance into the town, there appeared a small body of Indians, who immediately fled at the first onset, and by that means decoyed the whole body of militia, by making their flight into different directions, and encouraging the militia to pursue; by this means the regular troops were left alone, and the Indians had effected their design; for the moment they found the small handful of regular troops detached from the main body of militia, they commenced the attack with their whole force, excepting the flying parties that had diverted the militia; and although they soon found some part of the militia returning on their back, pursued their object of routing and destroying the troops; as the only sure plan of success; which, after the bloody conflict on each side, they effect. The regular troops, all to nine, including two commissioned officers, were killed and disabled, and a total defeat ensued. Among the slain were Major Wylls, of Hartford, and Lieut. Frothingham, of Middletown. Of the militia, it is said, about an hundred were killed, among whom were a number of brave and valuable characters. The Indians, it appears, from some cause, did not think it prudent to pursue their successes from the field of action, for most of the troops that were not killed, or sorely wounded, made their escape, which they never could have done had the Indians pursued with their usual fury. Nothing can exceed the intrepidity of the Indians on this occasion; the militia they appeared to despise, and with all the undautedness conceivable, threw down their guns, and rushed upon the bayonets of the regular soldiers; a great number of them fell; but being so far superior in numbers soon overpowered them, for while the poor soldier had his bayonet in one Indiaman, two more would sink their tomahawks in his head. The defeat of our troops was complete, the dead and wounded were left on the field in possession of the savages. No damage, of any consequence, has been sustained in this part of the country from the Indians; but what effect the expedition may have on us, as relates to our frontier, it uncertain.– If the Western Indians have any idea of treating for peace, we shall be safe; if not, we are much exposed. war;Native Americans
        ID324Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17910121informExtract of a letter from Norfolk (Virginia), Oct. 26. We learn from the West Country, that the Kentucky Convention has determined in favour of a separation, and large preparations are making in the country for offensive operations against the Indians, who have committed so many murders, and harassed the country so much, that it can no longer be endured. Such devastation may shortly be expected to take place,that the name of a Shawenese nation will be no more. that on this side the Cumberland mountains, please prospects are in view; a general peace is likely to take place with the Southern Tribes; a regular and efficient system of government is about being established under the auspices of Congress: one of the mildest seasons in a temperate and salubrious climate, with the most exuberantharvest, gives joy to the husband, and animates the diligence and industry of all. Extract of a letter from a Gentleman on the Ohio. Since my last, the Gentlemen I mentioned to you are forming themselves into a Company, for the purpose of building three vessels of force, amounting from twenty to forty 24 pounders, completely manned and quipped. They purpose loading with tobacco, flour, &c. and proceed tos ea by the gulph of Mexico, with a full determination to punish severely every insult which, in violation of treaties, may be offered to the American flag, sailing down the Mississippi. It is generally supposed they will embark between twelve and fifteen hundred men, in orto???

        ID327Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17910207informCONGRESS. Wednesday, Dec. 8. The SPEECH of George Washington , Esq; President of the Congress, on??? the ??? Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and House of Representatives, I N meeting you again, I feel much satisfac tion on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty, and with the means of flourishing commerce. The progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American stock abroad, as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes, have been productive beyond the calculation by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing, as it is not only a proof the fertility of our resources, but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add, as it bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the marine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary. In conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session, a loan of 3,000,,000 of florins, towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place, has been completed in Holland.–As well theexchange with which it has been filled, as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing, created by the situation of Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers, may proceed with advantage and success. The secretary of the treasure has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information. Since your last sessions, I have received communication, by which it appears, that the district of Kentucke, at present a part of Virginia, has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state, in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct number of the Union; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted, will be found to do great honour to both the par ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of the Union and its present Government, expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke, cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare, to the great national impressions under which you will declare on the case submitted to you. It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the north west side of the Ohio. These, with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash, have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and, being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes, and aided by such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities, or afford them a retreat for their prisoners, and plunder, they have, instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States, renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect–The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed, and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking, whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity. These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements, that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes, than it is disposed to respect their rights and rewards their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures, it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers; and I have accordingly authorised an expedition, in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me, The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded, as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended. The disturbed situation of Europe, and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers, whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States, reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war, and even of preparations for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country, to abridge in means, and there by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections, how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies, by such encouragements to ur own navigation as will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms, which may fail us in the moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce, offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil. Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it destresful to us, that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection. The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system, have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom, whether improvement of a judicatory system, have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. Yu will consider in your wisdom, whether im provements in that system may yet be made, and particularly whether??? ???process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal Courts, be not desirable through all the States. The patronage of our commerce, of our merchants and seamen, has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them, either by express convention, or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too, with his most Christian Majesty, has stipulated in certain cases, the aid of the National authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect. The establishment of the Militia, of a Mint, of Standards of Weights and Measures, of the Post Office and Post Roads, are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course, and which are abundantly urged by their own importance. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives, The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated, leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope, that it will be a favourite policy with you, not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt founded, but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit, to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject, and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute, along with other means, to the actual reduction of the public debt, the more salutary will the measure be toe very public interest, as well as be more satisfactory to our constituents. Gentlemen of the Senate, and House of Representatives. In perusing the various and weighty business of the present session, I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom, and animated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty, you shall have all the co-operation which an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both, and our best reward, if by a successful administration of our respective trusts, we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens, and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence.

        ID328Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17910121informThe following, it is said, are the authentic particulars of General St Clair's expedition in America. The Miamis Indians had been for a long time extremely troublesome to the Americans, and it was determined to drive them to the back country. General St. Clair completely accomplished this object; but on the 22d Oct. a detachment of 400 Americans fell in with the Indians on the River St. Joseph, where a severe battle was fought. Many Indians were killed, but the Americans lost the field; several Officers, and 150 men were killed, and they were not able even to bring off their wounded. This success will in all probability give the Indians new courage, and induce them again to make head against the American army. Native Americans
        ID329Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17910131informExtract of a letter from Boston, New England, Dec. 11. The demands for the produce of America are most rapidly increasing: one single house has actuallyexported and sold, within a very short time, 2000 barrels of pot and pear ashes, 2000 barrels of beef, 500 ditto of pork, 70,000lb. weight of butter, and 1500 bushels of bean and peas. Our news from New York is very disagreeable indeed. Gen. Scott, Major Fountain, Major Willis, Capt. M'Murtry, and Lieut. Fortingham, have all fallen sacrifices to the Indians, after a terrible conflict on the banks of a river; there were such numbers of the Indians killed,and thrown into the river, that their dead bodies actually stopped the current of it. The frost is very intense at New York During the late gales of wind, the smugglers have been uncommonly active on all the coasts of the kingdom. The risk of their lives secured their property–for the Custon-house boats were afraid to follow them. From many parts of the country we have received accounts of the land being entirely flooded by the late heavy rains. A prisoner who was tried last week try town sessions, for stealing iron, being acquitted by the Jury, addressed them in the following words: Gentlemen, I most sincerely thank you for your lenity, and promise never to be guilty of the like offence again. international trade;Native Americans;crime

We are informed that the census of Philadelphia is completed, and that the city is found to contain fifty three thousand inhabitants. A Petersburgh (Virginia) paper of the 30th ult. informs the public of that state, that a serious petition is now drawing up, to be presented to the next congress, stating arguments in favour of polygamy, from the plain principles of reason; and praying that a man may legally marry two wives. This, it is thought, will be the most effectual means to extirpate the numerous race of old maids, and increase the population of the United States. The petition is to be presented by a gentleman residing at Cabin Point. Oct 12. In one of the Charleston papers of the 16th ult. appears the epistle from the yearly meeting of the Quakers in London, to the friends in Great Britain, Ireland and America. It is remarkable that in the re-publication of this episstle in the Carolina paper, the whole paragraph relative to theslave trade and negro slavery is omitted. Oct. 13. The ship Betsy, Rook, arrived on the 6th instant, at Wilmington, Delaware,, from Londonderry, in Ireland. This vessel brought in a large number of Irish emigrants, some of them people of property; who, weary of the patronage of their old tutelar saint, St. Patrick, have come to settle themselves and their posterity in America, under the more liberal auspices of St. Tammany. The following letter was written from a young heir to the Probate Judge–Sir–My father departed this life not long hence, and has left a widow and five scorpions.

And as in duty bound ??? ??? pray, &c. Extract of a letter from a gentleman, in the county of Lincoln, Massachusets, dated Sept. 14. We have had a very wet season here since you went from us, and the grass hoppers are innumerable; they have eat up all the gardens, and all the grass; of course, as the natural consequences, we have no milk, neither shall we have any beef or butter this season; the corn has also suffered very much from those insects Extract of a letter from Banbury (Georgia) Sept. 20 A firm peace being now, to all appearance, secured between the United States and the Creek Indians, we may reasonable expect that the state of Georgia will soon begin to feel the good effects. The immediate beneficial consequences are already at this moment taking place. The vast tracts of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw river are rapidly rising in value, and nothing is wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men, who instead of being mere lookers on, in quality of overseers and drivers, would condescend to put their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe, and make this extensive territory one of the most desirable in the habitable world. The country round Sapola Sound and the mouth of Altamahaw, is one of the most beautiful you can imagine,abounding with everything that can make life comfortable, besides an excellent navigation and easy bar at the north end of Sapola, with rather more water than that of Charleston. Several vessels are hourly looked for from France, (one in particular of 800 tons from Bourdeaux) to load with live oak ship timber and??? in the river of St. Mary's. Extract of a letter from Hampton (Virginia) Sept. 25. There are two articles produced in the greatest abundance on different parts adjoining James river, the exportations of which, in the opinion of rational men, ought to be considered as of the greatest importance to this state. These articles are coals, and clays for the several colours of paint, which may be had in any quantity, and may be afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal, from every discovery we have been able to make, are inexhaustible; all the samples, however, that you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the surface, and there is reason to believe that the deeper we shall descend the better will be the quality of the coal. When once a company can be estblished with funds sufficient to take this matter in hand, there is no doubt but that we can supply the different capital of the United States with coal equally good with that from Europe, and at a much a more moderate price than that frequently brought. As to our paints, there are none better in the world, and in quantity, when manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country up the river, of property and enterprize, are beginning to turn their attention to these branches; and with all submissions to our legislature, it is thought that these two articles are by no means objects beneath their attention. Extract of a letter from Charleston, Sept. 27. On Sunday last weas launched at Mr. Pri?chard's ship yard, Hubcaw, a fine new brig, calculated to carry 700 barrels of rice, the property of Mr. Hary Grant, and is to be called the Pringle. A number of spectators collected from the city to view the pleasing sight, with which they were no less delighted, than with the liberal en tertainment and polite attention of Mr. O???. Boston, Sept. 28. Yesterday sailed from this port, the ship Columbia, Capt. Robert Gray, on a circum navigation voyage to the North-West coast of America.–This is the second voyage the Columbia has made to our coast–too much praise cannot be given to the gentlemen, owners of the ship, for their exertion in extending the commerce of America. The native of??? has returned to the place of its nativity. Dr. FRANKLIN Never declare yourself the author of a???, without being, beyond doubt, certain of???, was the Doctor's advice. He generally enforced his percepts by giving an example. I had been with a number of my acquaintance taking the diversion of a dance at an inn. The fiddler stepped out to get some refreshment. the tavern keeper came in and advised us in a very warm manner to make a collection for the fiddler who had been scraping his cat gut several hours in our service; we apparently agreed, and he well pleased with the success of his persuasion, went for his hat to collect what we were willing to give. We took up an old newspaper, tore it into small pieces, which we carefully folded and put into our pockets. The tavern keeper goes round the room, and we, very gravely, drop our paper in his hat. The fiddler returns, and the landlord with a cheerful face and an air of self approbation, boasts of what he had been doing for him; It was I persuaded them to make the collection, I made them give, I went round to every one, and see what I have got. If it had not been for me–the fiddler examines his prize, and discovers the cheat–he vents all his anger upon the poor landlord's shoulders, who thus suffered for proclaiming himself the author of a project before its success was fully ascertained. census;reprinting;slavery;shipping;emigration and immigration;war;Native Americans;slavery;mining;shipping;international trade

Winchester, Oct. 20. By recent intelligence from Kentucky we learn that a short time ago an American vessel was seized at New Orleans, and her cargo disposed of by the Spaniards. Also, that the troop which went out against the Indians had, not far from the banks of the Ohio, fallen in with about forty of them, whom they made their prisoners, after a slight resistance; and that having washed them, 15 turned out to be white men. Philadelphia, Nov 9. We hear from undoubted authority, that a considerable loan has been negotiated in Holland for the service of these United States. Albany, Nov. 4. The Legislature of Vermont have resolved to pay to the State of New York 30,000 dollars, agreeably to the first proposition contained in the declaration of the Commissioners of this State, appointed to declare the consent of the Legislature thereof, that a certain territory within the jurisdiction of the State of New York be erected into a new State on the 17th of October last; in consequnece whereof, all rights and titles to lands within the State of Vermont, under grants of the late colony of New York, or from the State of New York (except such grants as were intended as confirmations of those from New Hampshire) cease and determine. The Legislature have also resolved, that a Convention be called for taking into consideration the constitution of the United States; the members to be elected in December, and the Convention to Meet the first week in Jauary. The Legislature have adjourned to meet again on the first Thursday in January, for the purpose (we suppose) of choosing Senators, and affixing the time and manner of electing Representatives for Congress. New York, Nov. 18. The following resolution has passed the House of Representatives of the State of Virginia now in session: Resolved, That so much of this act, entitled, An Act, making provision for the provision for the debt of the United States in their redemption of the public debt, is dangerous to the rights, and subversive of the interest of the people; and demands the marked disapprobation of the General Assembly. Portland, Nov. 15. The stone work of the light house, at the entrance of our harbour, is now completed. On Tuesday the 9th instant, the last stone was laid by Mr. Nichols, of this town, master builder. The work is extremely well executed. The lighthouse is now 70 feet high. To this the lanthorn, which is to be six feet in diameter, will add about 15 feet, 85 feet in whole. The lanthorn is now preparing, and will probably be raised and lighted by the first of next month. Baltimore, Nov. 23. A society of respectable gentlemen of this place have raised an adequate fund for the establishment of an extensive manufacture of gunpowder, and the necessary mill-works will be speedily erected in the vicinity of this town. This important insituation will not only prove highly advantageous to this State and town, but may, if properly encouraged, become a national benefit. York (Pennsylvania), Nov 10. From Wright's Ferry we learn, that about four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, as a boat was coming from the East side, a most tremendous storm arose when she was about half way over, by which means she was soon filled with water, and sunk. there was six passengers and the??? in her (besides a small light waggon and three horses, viz. a clergyman, the owner of the waggon, with his wife and three children; when the storm came on, the woman and children took shelter in the waggon, but it continued to blow with such violence that the waggon was torn out of the boat, and the body having by chance got loose from the carriage, and being pretty tight, floated some distance till its progress was stopped by a rock; the husband, viewing the melancholy situations of his wife and children, resolved to relieve or perish with them, and quitting the boat swam to the waggon, cut open the cover with his knife, and with difficulty kept their heads above water till they were relieved by a boat from the West side; by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappeared; the Clergyman just as he found the boat sinking mounted his horse, one of the boatmen mounted on one of the waggon horses, and by this means preserved themselves till they were relieved by a boat; the other boatman of the name of Tim Sulivan, depending on his skill in swimming got up an oar, but it is thought he is drowned, as he has not since been heard of; the boat was found in the falls, and one of the waggon horses that had been given up for lost, was found next day some distance below the falls, with all his geers on, and does not appear to have received the least injury. Extract of a letter from Sunbury, Northumberland County (Pennsylvania), dated Nov. 13. One of the men who murdered the Indians at Pine Creek, was tried on Saturday evening, and though a number of witnesses clearly proved the hand he had in perpetrating the horrid deed, and the confession of his counsel at the bar that confirmed it, yet, notwithstanding an express charge from the judges to bring him in guilty, the jury in a few moments returned with a verdict in his favour, and a subscription to pay the costs of the suit, that he might be immediately set at liberty; and all this from a most absurd idea, which the Attorney General, with all his endeavours, could not beat out of them, that the crime was not the same to kill an Indian as a white man: for some minuets the Chief Justice was mute with astonishment. How the State can pacify the Indians now, Heaven knows, while at this moment the other murderers are at large in this country, and no one will arrest them. shipping;Native Americans;war;colonial government;colonial politics;weather;crime

A large body of them, on the 2d of February, attacked the settlements called Big Bottom, twenty miles from Harman, on the Muilsingam, which they entirely destroyed. Eleven men and two children were massacred, two escaped and three were taken prisoners. Boston. The amount of the value of theexports from the United States, for thirteen months, agreeable to an estimate made at the Office of the Treasury, in 20,000,000 dollars. The greatest apprehensions are entertained of an invasion from our savage neighbours; as accounts from Philadelphia state, that there has been a confederation of all the South West Indians to fall on our frontiers early in the spring. Similiar apprehensions have driven the inhabitants in the country of Marcetta, from their plantations into the city, where they do military duty. According to the late Census, the number of inhabitants in this commonwealth is 470,000. Philadelphia, April 7. Congress met here to-day and made a house, Articles of the Constitution, that were not liked by many of us, are altered much for the better– among other things, we were dissatisfied that not any notice was taken of Religion, as we wanted it expressly declared, that not any sect should ever be established in preference to another.–This is now done. In this part of the world we know not any thing of Toleration–all are equally free. It is said we have land for upwards of an hundred millions of people; we are yet about three, so that,for sometime we have have not any great cause to fight for territory. weather;Native Americans;war;international trade;census;colonial government;religion

        ID347Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17910221informRichmond, Virginia, Dec. 1, 1790. Extract of a letter from a Gentleman at Kentucky, to a Member of the General Assembly, dated, Nov. 7, 1790. I have been waiting with much impatience to obtain some certain account of our troops; many probably conjectures still fill the minds of the people. A hand-bill just come to Bourbon, contains an extract of a letter from Governor St. Clair to General Wilkinson, which mentions that our army had met with but little opposition. The Miami villages were abandoned, from thence a detachment was sent up to St. Joseph's river, which fell in with a party of Indians, and had a severe engagement. General Harmar made a shew of retreating, and marched about eight miles, when he detached a strong party to the field of action, in hopes of finding the Indians on the ground; as they expected, so they found them, and an action immediately commenced, which was obstinate on both sides. A vast number of Indians were killed in crossing the St. Joseph's river. Major Fountain, of Fayette, and General Scott's son were killed the second fire; Capt. M'Murty and 73 militiamen were killed; Major Willis, Lieut. Fotheringham, of the F–deral troops, and 77 privates, also fell in the action. General Harmar did not send a single man to reinforce the detachment, consisting of 400 men, (who had to sustain the fire of the whole Indian army) although he had with him in camp upwards of 1100 men. Our men at last lost ground, Colonel Harding's wing was beaten, and finally broke. Lieutenant Colonel Hall, of Bourbon, and Majors M'Million and Willis broke the other wing of the Indians, which occasioned the amazing slaughter in the river St. Joseph. General Harmar never sent to bring off the wounded, nor bury the dead. Captain David Thrope and Lieut. Clark fell in the field. The Bourbon militia has suffered very much, nearly one third of them having fallen on the spot. The army is now at Licking, and is expected home hourly. This is the best account that I have been able to collect; it will be delivered to you by Major Jones, who before he leaves the district, may be enabled to obtain further particulars. Native Americans
        ID348Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17910221informMusquito Shore. Intelligence has been received, that in some trivial dispute with a native Indian, a Spaniard has stabbed him to the heart with a stiletto, and then fled. The nation to whom the Indian belonged, being made acquainted with the murder, sent a deputation to the Governor, demanding that five Spaniards should be instantly delivered up as an attonement. This was peremptorily refused, as being more than commensurate to the offence, but the murderer was offered as a satisfaction; the Indians would not accept him singly, and departed, vowing the severest revenge: a few days afterwards intelligence was received that they had surprised and massacred sixteen men, who had been at work in the woods; and when the vessel departed, the Spaniards were flying, with the utmost precipitation and terror, from all parts of the country, seeking shelter in the forts. Native Americans;crime

This day arrived the ship Albion, John Simmons, master, in 47 days from Rotterdam; on the 8th lying to in a heavy gale of wind, the Albion shipped a sea, which carried away all her boats and every loose article from the deck; there were three men of the watch, one of whom is washed overboard and perished– his name is John M'Naught, and belonged to Greenock. Extract of a letter from a gentleman at the falls of the Ohio, to his relation inWinchester, Virginia. dated April 13, 1791. I wrote to you from Fort Pitt, which place we left the 3d. inst. in company with two other boats, and proceeded to Limestone, without meeting or apprehending danger–at that place we were informed of several disasters which had befallen boats going down the river, and one to a boat going up to a French station, loaded with bacon, butter, &c. The particulars relative to the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked by about 60 or 70 Indians, and the flankets that were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. –Immediately after firing, they gave the Indian whoop, and rushing on the flankets, scalped them every one (about 22)– they then fired at the boat, but did no damage, as it required some time to make their way into the river. After the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity, they continued on the river watching for other boats. In the course of about six days, five or six boats happened to come down the river–the savages attacked the foremost of them, in which were two young ladies, of the name Macdonald, a young gentleman, and some others, passengers, and took it. Elevated with this easy capture, they imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in with–In a little time a second boat hove in fight, which they attacked with great fury–they were in three canoes, each canoe containing about twenty–they moved towards the boat, as it came down, and commenced firing; after discharging their guns, they retreated, loading and came on a second time, fired and repeated nine different times; as often as they come on, there was a brisk firing kept up from the boat, which contained nine fighting men;– during the conflict two were killed, and five wounded; two only remained to protect the boat, and prevent the Indians from boarding it, which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the ???, they threw billets of wood at them, and one of them took up an ax, as a weapon of defence, should they persist in boarding, which the Indians perceiving, and, as is supposed, their ammunition being expended, they retreated, without accomplishing their object. These inhuman monsters, previous to their attacking the last mentioned boat, placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes, in which situation they were both killed. A few days after this transaction, they fired at another boat, and killed one young man. In short, every boat tat has gone down the river lately, has been fired at, except our's. We saw no Indians; the places where the above depredation happened we passed in the night. Boston, May 4.

On Friday last, the venerable Mr. John Simonds, of Salem, entered the one hundredth year of his age. He is the only male person who has arrived at that great age from the first settlement of the town by the English, in 1629, to the present day. New York, June 9. General Washington, on his tour to the Southern Sates, landed at Charlestown, South Carolina, in a barge decorated for the purpose, with colours and pendants, and rowed by twelve American Captains and a Cockswain, all dressed in blue silk jackets, black silk breeches, white stockings, and blue roses to their shoes. They had likewife hold laced hats; with silk bandeaus, with the motto, Long live the President. An immense number of people assembled near the Quay, and on board the vessels in the river, which, as well as works, saluted him with several discharges of artillery. The day was afterwards devoted to conviviality–The lodge of St. John addressed his Excellency as follows:– Right Worshipful Sir, We the Master, Officers and Members of St. John's Lodge, No. 2 of Newbern, beg leave to hail you welcome with three times three ! We approach you not with the language works have proved you to be the true and faithful Brother, the skilful and expert Craftsmen, the just and upright Man. But the powers of eloquence are too feeble to express with sufficient energy, the cordial warmth with which our bosoms glow towards you–We therefore most frevently wish–more ardently and devoutly pray, that the Providence of the Most High, may strengthen, establish and protect you in your walk through life–and when you are called off from your terrestrial labours, by command of our divine grand master, and your operations sealed with the mark of his approbation, may your soul be everlastingly refreshed with the streams of living water which flow from the right hand of God. And when the Supreme Architect of all world's shall collect his most precious jewels, as ornaments of the Celestial Jerusalem–may you eternally shine among those of the brightest lustre. To which the President returned the following answer:– Gentlemen, I receive the cordial welcome which you are pleased to give me, with sincere gratitude. My best ambition having aimed at the unbiassed approbation of my fellow citizens, it is peculiarly pleasing to find my conduct so affectionately approved,, by a fraternity whose association is founded on justice and benevolence. In reciprocating the kind wishes contained in your address, be persuaded, that I offer a sincere prayer for your present and future happiness. George-Town. April 30. Yesterday morning, about one or two o'clock, the ship Termagant, belonging to the house of Messrs. Claggen, lying in the stream opposite this town, was discovered on fire. The inhabitants of the town and the seamen in the harbour speedily collected, but on account of a quantity of powder that was on board, the efforts that otherwise would have been exerted to extinguish the flames were withholden. The first soon communicated itself to the powder; and the explosion was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of the ship were flying in every direction, and it and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting, store and dwelling houses, on the water side, were prevented from sharing a similar fate with the ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse, the property of Francis and Charles Loundes, situated at some distance from the water, wherein upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stored, was several times, in different places, on fire, ut happily extinguished without sustaining much damage. The loss, occasioned by this alarming element, must be great indeed, as the ship was large and nearly new; besides, there were goods to a considerable amount, and a pretty large sum of money on board of her: all of which (excepting a part of the money, which has since been found) was destroyed. We are informed that this accident proceeded from the steward's falling to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cabbin, which by some means or other, set fire to the sails that were stowed there. It had got far advanced before it was discovered. Providentially no lives were lost. Pittsburgh, May 21. A letter received in this town, on Sunday last, from Lieut. Jeffers, at Fort Franklin, mentions, that an Indian had arrived there, who brought him intelligence that 300 warriors of the Chippawa and other nations had set out for war and that they were determined to strike on the Allegheny or Ohio, near Petersburgh; that 1000 men were preparing, but their destination was not known. shipping;weather;war;Native Americans;textiles;gambling;longevity;fire;international trade
