Extract of a letter from a gentleman in America to  his friend in Greenock ."No doubt, Sir, you have been expecting this some time a remittance in money for your goods; but as part of them is still on hand, I could not properly answer you in cash or bills ; however, if you will accept of wheat in return, it shall be immediately sent you ; for our wheat crop has been so plentiful that we can supply you with many thousand bolls of an eceeding fine quality ; and to my knowledge there are several ships loading for your market at present."
