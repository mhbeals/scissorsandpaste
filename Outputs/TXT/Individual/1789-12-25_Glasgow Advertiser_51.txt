By letters from America, dated the 5th ult. we learn, that wheat is so great a crop all over the Provinces, that it has fallen at Virginia to [?] a bushel. At Philadelphia it is 7s. 6d. paper currency, about 3s. 8d. Sterling per bushel;--which has reduced the price in France in from 48s. to 42s. 2d. and it is 20s. per quarter lower in Holland than it was four months ago.Two ships, laden with American wheat, have already arrived at Bristol, where the cargoes were immediately purchased by the dealers. Large orders are sent to America for wheat, of which there has been a prodigious crop.
