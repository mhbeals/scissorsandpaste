October  31. We are informed by very respectable authority, that Mr. M'Gillvry has written to the President of the United States, a full and sensible account of the rise and progress of the disputes subsisting between the Georgians; from which statement he expected to prove, to a demonstration, that he has not acted the inconsistent part which some have alleged, neither has there been such cruelties committed by the Indians.From Mr. M'Gillevry's abilities, and considering he was educated in Europe, being the son of a Scotchman and Indian women, we have no reason to expect any savage cruelties from an of his people; but, on the contrary, it is rather to be presumed that his proposals, which are contained in his letter to the President, are of a rational nature, and many probably bring about a final and an advantageous treaty with the United States.
