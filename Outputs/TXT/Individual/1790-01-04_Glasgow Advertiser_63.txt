November  12. On Thursday last the Viscount de Ponteves gave a surperb entertainment and ball to a number of respectable ladies of gentleman of this town on board l'Illustre, of seventy-four guns. The boats of the fleet, the state yacht and barge, received the company at Foster's wharf, before 12 o'clock--and on the appearance of the first boat having ladies on board, a signal gun was fired from l'Illustre, and in an instant the squadron was beautifully arrayed with the flags of all nations. On arriving at the ship, the company were very politely received by the Viscount, and conducted to the state room--the marines saluting as the company passed them. At one o'clock the whole sat down to a table liberally spread with a profusion of luxuries and delicacies, in a hall erected for the occasion, which was very fancifully decorated. At the head of the table was a castle of pastry, having thirteen metal guns, by which from tubes that communicated through the table, and the company were saluted with a f--deral discharge. On the top of the castle waved a small white ensign--the device, two hearts--the motto, " The United hearts of America and France." The head of the hall was ornamented with a heart pieced with arrows--and in the motton, " Homage to the fair daughters of America," a fine compliment made by the noble Viscount to his female guests. After dinner, the ball began, and closed before nine o'clock, and on departure, his Excellency was saluted with thirteen rockets let off from a boat moored at some distance from the ship.Rhode Island and North Carolina yet remain averse to the new government; they refuse allegiance to all acts of the States, and, of course, do not participate in any privilee; they are treated in respect to port entries, &c. as foreign States.
