On Friday died, at his seat at Cromford, the celebrated Sir Richard Arkwright, who introduced the spinning of cotton on Jennies. This gentleman was once a barber that shaved at a penny, but, by this abilities, raised himself to the state of immense opulence, and established the cotton manufacture, for which this country owes him the greatest obligation. It is said, that the profits of his works, for several years past, have amounted to forty thousand pounds  a year.
