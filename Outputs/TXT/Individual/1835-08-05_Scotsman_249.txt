Emigration--We observe from an advertisement in our paper of to-day, that another ship is fitting out by Government, for the free conveyance of females to Van Dieman's Land ; and as we understand that many applications were made too late for the last ship, we would recommend those anxious to take advantage of this opportunity, to lose no time in making the neccessary application at Leith,--the number being strictly limited, and being the last ship to sail this year. We consider it of great advantage to females of respectability, that none are admitted without a strict investigation into their moral character by the Emigration Committee ; and that those of a superior class, as governesses, &c. are provided a small sum, to defray the expense of the extra outfit.
