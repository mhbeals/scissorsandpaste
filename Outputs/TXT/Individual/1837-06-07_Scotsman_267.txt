Religion in Australia.--An Act of Council has passed to the effect, that whenever t300 are raised for the erection of a church and parsonage, the Government may advance the same sum--and that if one hundred adults sign a declaration of their wish for a clergyman, a salary of t100 may be given--if two hundred a salary of t150, and if five hundred, a salary of t200. Already nine clergyman are wanted.
