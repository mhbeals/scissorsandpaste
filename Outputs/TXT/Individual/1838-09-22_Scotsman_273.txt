The King of Prussia and his Catholic Sub- jects.--The German Courier in an article date Berlin, 5th instant, refers to the late arrests in Posen, and accuses the Catholic clergy of stimulating their flocks to revolt. The Prussian Government had, in consequence, increased its exertions to conciliate the Court of Rome, in hopes that its influence would be exercised over the clergy, and induce them to return to their allegiance. On the other hand, the sect of Separatists, who had resolved to emigrate from Austria to Australia, because of the interference of Government with their religious belief, amounted to 40,000 souls. It was said they would be joined by a great number of the inhabitants of Pomerania.
