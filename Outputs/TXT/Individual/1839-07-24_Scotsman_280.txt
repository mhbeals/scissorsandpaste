Collision at Sea.--We are sorry to learn that the fine new ship Palmyra, which sailed from Greenock on her first voyage for Sydney, New South Wales, on Wednesday week, having a large number of respectable emigrants on board, came in dreadful collision when at sea, on Sunday evening, with another vessel, and had her bulwark driven in and some of the masts dismantled, but providentially no lives were lost. She was towed back to Greenock on Wednesday morning, and the utmost exertions are making for her re-sailing from Greenock early next week.
