Church in New South Wales.--Dr Gordon, as Convener of the committee to whom the dissensions that at present existed among the Presbyterian churches in Australia had been remitted by last Commission, stated that the Committee had prepared a report ; but that since it was made up, several important documents had come to hand, which, in justice to Dr Lang, ought to be considered. He therefore asked leave to delay the report, and to have the matter, with these documents, recomitted to the committee.--This motion was agreed to, on the understanding that the question would be again taken up at the meeting of the Commission on the 11th December.
