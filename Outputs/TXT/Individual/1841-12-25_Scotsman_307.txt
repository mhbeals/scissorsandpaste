Emigration.A Return, just published, shows that emigration is still proceeding upon a gigantic scale:--Emigrants from the United Kingdom in 1840. England. Scotland. Ireland. Total. To North American colonies, 5,303 3,053 23,935 32,293 United States, 35,309 1,246 4,087 40,0 Other parts of America, 44 ---- 44 West Indies, 745 687 159 1,591 The Cape, 315 8 -- 323 Australia and New Zealand, 14,495 817 538 15,850 56,213 5,811 28,719 90,743We have not the previous Returns at hand, but we believe that a larger number of emigrants never left the shores of the British Isles in one year than the above. It is startling to think, that 1800 persons quit the kingom every week never to return. The natural increase of the people must be about 1100 per day, of whom emigration carries off 250, leaving 850 to swell the Census.The emigration to our North American colonies was as follows:--To Canada, 21,209 --New Brunswick, 8,056 -- Newfoundland, 387 --Nova Scotia, 972 --Cape Breton, 437 Prince Edward's Island, 1,214 Hudson's Bay, 18 32,293To Australia it was:--Swan River, 224 South Australia, 2,748 Port Philip, 3,473 Sydney, 7, Van Diemen's Land, 299 14,392
