TradeWool--The accounts received in Lond from New South Wales to the 8th of January, state that the produce of the last year's clip of wool in Australia will be greatest than that of the preceding year, and the the quality has also considerably improved. From Van Dieman's Land it is now ascertained that the supply this year will be short, but the general quality is very superior. In the course of about a week or ten days, large arrivals of wool are looked for from New South Wales and the private contract business is expected to be very active. The public sales of wools went off on Friday very well, and at full prices. The arrivals of this week have consisted of about 708 bales, of which about 292 bales were Van Dieman's Land wools, and the rest German. There is a steady demand, and as it is understood that the manufacturers are short of stock, the anticipations are that trade will son be greatly improved.York Wool Market, May  23.--The market commenced here for this season this day, with only a small show of wool, and not many buyers. The holders asking very high prices caused part to be left unsold. The following are the prices ; Hogs from 18s to 19s ; Hogs and Ewes 16s 6d to 17s 6d ; Locks 11s to 12s, 6d per stone of 16lbs.Bradford Market--The supply of Merinos in the markets on Thursday evening, was by no means equal to the demand--all qualities in six quarter wide Merinoes were eagerly bought up, and in some instances a farther advance was obtained ; three quarter wide Merinoes run much in demand, but a very scanty supply ; the advance on six quarter wide Merinoes is from 4s to 6s per piece, compared with what was given at the beginning of the year, and three quarter wide are proportionably higher. Unless a reduction takes place in the price of wool, the manufacturers state they must have a further advance.Rochdale Flannel Market.--The market today was very lively for this season of the yar ; low goods both for white and for dyeing were of very ready sale, and in some instances a little advance was obtained ; several sales were effected in fine qualities, and if the demand proves permanent, the prospect for the coming season is very promising.Liverpool Cotton Market.--There has been but a limited inquiry for cotton during the week ; the sales are only about 10,000 bugs, at declining prices.-----------------------------------------------------------------Emigration.--Within these few days, other three vessels left Leith for America and Australia with emigrants. The Marjory, Stocks, sailed on Friday for Quebec and Montreal, with about 30 passengers ; and the Economist, Slocombe, on Sunday for Piciou and Quebec, with about 70. The Scotis, Watson, also sailed on Sunday for Van Diemen's Land, &c. with about 40 passengers.-----------------------------------------------------------------We have received Sydney papers to the 26th Feb., They contain reports of themost satisfactory nature as to the harvest at the Swan River Settlement; the promise of abundance had been fully realized, and the result is that the settlers have obtained from their own land five months' consumption of agricultural produce; thus affording well founded hopes that in two or three years they will be independent of foreign supply.--Globe.-----------------------------------------------------------------On Tuesday thirty-one male convicts were embarked at Leith for the hulks in the Thames, preparatory to their transhipment for New South Wales, except those in whose cases a commutation of punishment may take place.-----------------------------------------------------------------Edward Thorpe, a young lad, was remitted to the Sheriff, for having, broken into the New Market at Stocksbridge, and stolen a quantity of meat and other articles. He pled guilty; and we understand he has stated that he is anxious to get a free passage to New South Wales, as he is tired of living in this country.-----------------------------------------------------------------The Wool Trade.--The whole of the London public sales of Colonial and other woold having now been gone through, the wool trade is in a more settled state, and transactions by private contract are conducted on a more extensive scale. The total amount of the late sales, the last of which took place on Tuesday, was 4,000 bales, and the colonial wools were taken by the manufactures at the extreme advance realized at the previous sales in July. In some cases, indeed, quotations from 2d to 3d per lb. in advance were obtained. The sales on Saturday was most fully attended, and increased boldness was observed. The colonial wools offered on that day fetched excellent prices. Some few bales were also offered, forming a part of the second clip of wools in the new colony on the Swan River. They were much better in quality than those last received. Some German lambs' wool also commanded attention, and sold as high as 3s 10d to 4s per lb. The sale on Tuesday (the last of the series,) was not quite so fully attended as those of last wekk, but, according to quality, full prices were obtained. The sale consisted of 437 bales New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land wool, 96 bales of Portugal wool, 54 Spanish, and 72 bales of Cape, German, Russian, and other wools. The best fleece of Amsterdam offered fetched 2s 10d to 3s 2d, and seconds 2s 3d to 2s 7 1/2d per lb ; the best Portugal 1s 2d to 1s 11d ; the best Spanish 2s 5d to 2s 8d ; the best Cape 1s 4d to 1s 8d ; the best Van Diemen's Land 1s 8d to 1s 10d ; and the best German 2s to 2s 3d per lb. The result of these sales is to establish a much firmer market for wools of all descriptions than previously existed. The arrivals of wool are limited, and this week only 575 bales of German wool, and abotu 375 bales of Neapolitan wool have been entered at the custom house.-----------------------------------------------------------------Emigration.The returns to the House of Commons, on the motion of Mr Stewart Mackenzie, relative to emigration, contain some curious and important information. The returns are three in number.1. Return of the number of person who have emigrated from Great Britain and Ireland to the British colonies and to the United States of America, in each year from 1827 to the 31st of December 1832 ; distinguishing the ports from which they have sailed, and the countries to which such emigration took place.Of this return the following is the result:--1827. 1828. 1829. 1830. 1831. 1832. To the British Colonies in America,. 12,646 12,081 13,307 30,574 59,067 66,339 To the Cape of Good Hope,. 114 135 197 201 114 196 To the Australian Colonies, 715 1,056 2,010 1,242 1,561 3,733 To the United States, 14,526 12,817 15,678 24,887 23,418 32,872 Total, 28,003 26,092 31,198 56,907 83,160 103,4102.

Upper Canada, the great recipient of our surplus population, is 4000 miles from Britain, a distance which looks extremely formidable ; but such is the amazing economy of water carriage, when seconded by good arrangements, that the voyage by sea to Montreal can be made at as small expense as the journey by land to Manchester ! The passage money from Dublin to Montreal or Quebec (exclusive of food) has been as low as 30s ; and it would not be higher probably from Leith or Greenock, if the emigrants were in sufficient numbers, and so prompt in their arrangements, that the vessel lost no time beyond what was strictly necessary for taking her full compliment aboard. If the ship is detained a month before this is got, the owners must, of course, be indemnified for the detention by a higher fare. Four stone of oatmeal, with a little ham or salt fish for variety, will subsist a man or woman on the voyage ; and thus a human being can be conveyed over a distance equal to one-sixth part of the circumference of the globe, and six times longer, we dare say, than the wanderings of Ulysses, at the small coast of 45s !In an article in May 1832, we pointed out the rapid strides with which emigration was advancing ; and some Parliamentary papers we have received since, exhibit new proofs of its extraordinary progress. It has, in fact, outstripped the expectations of the most sanguine.The following table shows the number of person who have emigrated in the last eight years to North America, the Cape, and Australia :--British America. United States. Cape of G. Hope. Australia. Total. 1825 8,714 5,551 114 485 14,891 1826 12,818 7,063 116 903 20,900 1827 12, 14,526 114 715 28,003 1828 12,084 12,817 135 1,056 26,092 1829 13,307 15,678 197 2,916 31,198 1830 30,574 24,887 204 1,242 56,907 1831 58,067 23,418 11 1,561 83,160 1832 66,339 32,872 196 3,733 103,140It will be seen from this table how steady the increase of emigration has been, especially to Canada. It must be observed, that a great proportion, probably more than a half of those who sailed for the United States, were destined for the British colonies, and only chose that route as the most eligible, on account of the facilities which the Hudson and its associated canals present for travelling to the upper province. Canada and Nova Scotia must have drawn at least 80,000 settlers from Britain last year ; and yet, such are the capacities of these colonies for absorbing population, that the price of labour was not lowered in the least degree ; and from the previous arrangements made, it is announced that a much larger number of persons could have been received without inconvenience ! Sanguine as we were upon the subject, we did not anticipate that emigration could be conducted on such a scale, with the extraordinary ease, certainty, and economy now exemplified. Those who reflect on the distress and perplexity which would be produced by landing the sixth-part  of eighty thousand strangers on the shores of Britain in one summer, will appreciate the extremely dissimilar condition of a colony which, with less than a million inhabitants, can take in eighty-thousand new settlers in the same period without embarassment or confusion.The general result is, that Britain sent off 103,000 souls from her population last year, of whom a[?] number sailed 7000 miles, a number 14,000, and those who made the shortest voyage, 4000 miles. The annals of emigration afford nothing approaching to this in any part of the world ; and yet we may reasonably expect to see still greater things atcheived.It appears from the various census since 1801, that the annual increase in Britain, if no persons left it, would be about 350,000; or we may place the fact in a more striking light by stating, that there are about a thousand persons more in the three kingdoms every day than there was on the day before. If by raising the habits and ideas of the labouring classes, we could get this daily increase reduced one half, and the other half could be carried off by emigration--if we could by this means keep the supply of labour stationary while capital was increasing, a great improvement would be effected in the state of the population. Now from what has been stated it appears that the emigrants who leave our shores annually amount to nearly onethird of the annual excess already ; and in a year or two there is every probability that it will amount to one-half.Of 51,200 emigrants who landed at Quebec and Montreal last year, 17,500 went from England, 28,200 from Ireland, and 5,500 from Scotland. In the year 1831, the numbers were, from England 10,300, Ireland 34,100, Scotland 5,300.Of the emigrants from Scotland last year, 1716 sailed from Greenock, 1145 from Leith, 638 from Cromarty, 478 from Aberdeen, 439 from Dundee, 231 from Alloa, 181 from Islay, 175 from Anna, 160 from Glasgow, 112 from Leven, 110 from Campbeltown, and numbers under 100 from Stanraer, Peterhead, and Irvine.Of the emigrants to the United States last year 15,754 sailed from Liverpool, 5,546 from London 2,742 from Bristol, 2,613 from Londonderry, and 1,711 from Greenock.Mr Buchanan, the Government agent at Quebec, states in his Report, that "the general description of emigrants who arrived last year ; many respectable and wealthy families came from all part of the united kingdom ; and the extent of property and specie brought into the country by them is exceedingly great, fully amounting to from t600,000 to t700,000 sterling." About 5000 persons were sent out by pecuniary aid from parishes or landlords ; and there were 1700 "commuted pensioners" (military, we believe), many of them men of irregular habits, and ill fitted for the situation of settlers. Of these, about 100 returned to Britain. The fear of cholera was a considerable check to emigration. It appeared in Quebec on the 8th of June, and the persons who arrived after that, suffered much from the difficulty of procuring lodgings even for a day ; but Mr Buchanan estimates the whole number of emigrants who fell victims to the disease, at no more than"The demand for all classes of working people (says the Report,) has never been exceeded in the Canadas, particularly since the abatement of the cholera, and I can assure your Lordship that, during my late tour through the districts and settlements of Upper Canada, I did not see an industrious emigrant who could not meet with emplyment. The number of that class arrived this year is not adequate to supply the demand created by the more wealthy emigrants. This was particularly felt in the Western and London districts of the upper province, where the want of labourers was so great that it was found necessary to encourage a number to come over from Ohio and Pennsylvania." This was written on the 12th Dec. 1832, and the arrival of emigrants closed in October.-----------------------------------------------------------------Another cargo of females is now shipping on board the Ann, Captain Herd, in the London Docks, for Sydney. These ladies are going out in serarch of husbands, and to supply the lamentable scarcity of the fair sex in our Australian dominions. There is a bounty of t8 given by government towards defraying the expenses of the voyage ; and the ladies must be between 15 and 30, with good characters and sound constitutions. Ass servants they are much wanting among the respectable inhabitants of Sydney and the other towns in the colony.Emigration.--The governors of the Refuge for the Destitute, in the Hackney Road, have announced that it is their intention to send out a ship to New South Wales in the ensuing spring with 500 unmarried women or widows, between the ages of 18 and 30 years, as emigrants to New South Wales. It is intended to place the emigrants in divers situations, and leave them free and not bound to an employer.-----------------------------------------------------------------Emigration.--The governors of the Refuge for the Destitute, in the Hackney Road, have announced that it is their intention to send out a ship to New South Wales in the ensuing spring with 500 unmarried women or widows between the age of 18 and 30 years, as emigrants to New South Wales.
