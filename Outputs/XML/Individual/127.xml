                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Canada</hi></p>
                <p>Papers from Upper Canada contain the draft <lb/>of a petition to the Prince Regent, founded on <lb/>the resolutions adopted in the province of Nia<lb break="no"/>gara, where some discontent has been manifested. <lb/>The first part is as follows:–</p>
                <p>"To his Royal Highness George Prince of Wales, Regent <lb/>of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, <lb/>&amp;c. the humble Address of the Inhabitants of Upper <lb/>Canada</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">May it please your Royal Highness,</hi></p>
                <p>"The subjects of your Royal Father, dwelling in Upper <lb/>Canada, should need no words to give assurance of their <lb/>loyalty, if the whole truth had reached the throne of their <lb/>Sovereign. His subjects have reason to believe that the truth <lb/>has not been told.</p>
                <p>During three years of war, Upper Canada was exposed <lb/>to the ravages of a powerful and inveterate foe. The Go<lb break="no"/>vernment of the United States had been long concerting the <lb/>invasion of this province. Hostile preparations against it had <lb/>been long masked under other designs ; and at last the ac<lb break="no"/>cumulated torrent of violence burst on the defencless chil<lb break="no"/>dren of the British empire. Nor were they assailed by the <lb/>weapons of war alone ; an invidious proclamation preceded <lb/>those host of the enemy, forgetful of honour, regardless of hu<lb break="no"/>manity, and daring to seduce the subjects of Britain from <lb/>their true allegiance. The subjects of Britain remained <lb/>dauntless and firm. It was not for their property that they <lb/>rose against their invaders ; the invader would have spared to <lb/>them their property. They flew to arms in defence of the <lb/>rights and sovereignty of Britain. Twice has the American <lb/>standard been planted in Upper Canada, while yet but a hand<lb break="no"/>ful of British troops aided the native battalions wave the laurel of <lb/>victory over the protrate intruders on their soil. The se<lb break="no"/>cond year of war saw Canada contending with yet little as<lb break="no"/>sistance from the parent state. The second year of the war <lb/>saw her sons confirmed in their virtue, and still more deter<lb break="no"/>mined to resist. Wives and children had fled from their <lb/>homes ; the face of the country was laid waste, and the fire of <lb/>revenge was sent forth to consummate distress and misery ; <lb/>still was the spirit of the people unextinguished, still did it <lb/>burn with patriotism and loyalty.</p>
                <p>"By the third year every risk of conquest was at an end, for <lb/>now the British aid poured into the provinces, and peace <lb/>was proclaimed when war was no longer to be feared.</p>
                <p>"It is now more than three years since there was an end <lb/>of war, but, strange to say, these years of peace have ma<lb break="no"/>nifested no appearance of affection or care from the mother <lb/>country to the Canadas. Commercial treaties have been <lb/>made, altogether neglectful of British interests here. Go<lb break="no"/>vernment transactions, which used to give spirit to trade and <lb/>are at a stand; troops are withdrawn ; fortifications <lb/>are suffered to go to ruin ; and rumours are abroad too <lb/>shocking to be repeated in the Royal ear. May it please <lb/>your Royal Highness to listen calmly to the complains and <lb/>grievances of the people of Upper Canada who are fully <lb/>assured that your Royal Highness has been kept ignorant of <lb/>most important truths ; who are well assured of the gene<lb break="no"/>rous disposition of your Royal heart, and of your desire that <lb/>British subjects should every where share equally you pater<lb break="no"/>nal regard an affection.</p>
                <p>"It was a matter of much provocation to the people of <lb/>the province to see, even during the war, which afforded <lb/>such striking proofs of their loyalty and valour, reports <lb/>went home highly rating the merits of regular troops, <lb/>while the tribute due to Canadian levies were unfairly set <lb/>down, may, the principles of the most loyal subjects here <lb/>were often stigmatised by British officers, ignorant of <lb/>human character, and still more so of circumstances <lb/>which affect it in this part of the world. It was not so <lb/>with the immortal Brock. He justly appreciated Cana<lb break="no"/>dian worth, and his memory will happily long cherish, in <lb/>the minds of the Canadian people, a due regard for the <lb/>genuine spirit of a British solider, at once generous and <lb/>brave.</p>
                <p>"The loyal inhabitants of Upper Canada would disdain <lb/>to notice the misrepresentations of individuals, so contrary <lb/>to notorious truth, if these had not obviously conspired with <lb/>other causes to lessen the regard which should subsist be<lb break="no"/>tween British subjects here and at home, to influence the <lb/>conduct of Ministers towards the general interests of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince.</p>
                <p>"The loyal subjects of his Majesty in Upper Canada <lb/>suffered grievously during the war in their property, and <lb/>many were bereft of their all. A solemn investigation on <lb/>this subject took place ; the claims of the sufferers were au<lb break="no"/>thenticated, and there was every reason to expect that re<lb break="no"/>compence would immediately follow ; yet nothing has fol<lb break="no"/>lowed but delay and insult. Surely if there is among mankind <lb/>a single principle of justice, that is one, that the individuals <lb/>of a nation ought not, partially, to bear the weight of public <lb/>calamity. Surely individuals who have exposed their lives <lb/>for Government should not be disgusted with finding Go<lb break="no"/>vernment regardless of those very principles which it is in<lb break="no"/>tended to sustain. The people of this province are well <lb/>aware that their fellow subjects at home are pressed hard <lb/>with taxations, and far it is from their wish that relief <lb/>should be afford from thence. Canada contains within it<lb break="no"/>self ample means of exonerating Government from the <lb/>claims of sufferers by war ; and it is within the fiat[?] of your <lb/>Royal Highness to remove, by a signle breath, the evil now <lb/>justly complained of. Millions of acres of fertile lands lie <lb/>here at the disposal of your Royal Highness, upon the credit <lb/>of which, under proper management, not only the fair claims <lb/>of loyal sufferers could be instantly advanced, but vast sums <lb/>could be raised for the improvement of the provinces, and <lb/>the increase of revenue to Britain.</p>
                <p>"Another grievance, manifesting the neglect of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to the concerns of Upper Canada, is equally notorious, <lb/>and must be still more abhorrent to the general feelings of <lb/>your Royal Highness.</p>
                <p>"The young men of this province, who were armed in <lb/>its defence had, for their spirited conduct, the promise of <lb/>their commanders, that land would be granted them as a <lb/>reward for their services, as soon as war was terminated ; <lb/>and after this promise was universaly confided in the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Upper Canada passed an extraordinary law, in the face <lb/>of established British principles, that militia should pass <lb/>beyond the frontier. With these promises, and in obedience <lb/>to this law, the militia passed beyond the frontier with <lb/>alacrity ; yet since the peace, the greater part of them had <lb/>been denied the pledge of their extraordinary services, and <lb/>the land is unjudtly withheld."</p>
                <p>The petition further states that such ingratitude, <lb/>such dishonour, such errors in policy, could not <lb/>exist without extraordinary influences, and it <lb/>recommends most important changes equally for <lb/>the glory of the throne, and benefit of the <lb/>subject. It says that the scandalous abuses came <lb/>some years ago to such a pitch of monstrous in<lb break="no"/>gratitude, the the home Ministers wisely im<lb break="no"/>posed restriction on the Land Council of Upper <lb/>Canada. It seems, however, that all this was <lb/>insufficient, and that confusion on confusion has <lb/>grown out of this unhappy system. Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, it is now said, pines in comparative de<lb break="no"/>cay, and that discontent and poverty are expe<lb break="no"/>rienced in a land supremely blessed with the <lb/>gifts of nature.</p>
                <p>It is insisted that the immediate interfe<lb break="no"/>rence of his Royal Highness might do <lb/>much to remove the evils which spring from the <lb/>system of patronage and favouritism, and it as<lb break="no"/>serts that the interposition of the British Par<lb break="no"/>liament is more imperiously required. It con<lb break="no"/>cludes as follows:–" Deeply penetrated with <lb/>these sentiments, and most seriously inclined to <lb/>have changes speedily effected, the loyal <lb/>subjects of Great Britain dwelling in Upper <lb/>Canada now take the extraordinary step of send<lb break="no"/>ing home Commissioners to bear this to the <lb/>throne, and humbly intreat your Royal High<lb break="no"/>ness to give ear to the details which it will be in <lb/>their power to relate: above all, that your Royal <lb/>Highness would immediately send out to this <lb/>province a commission, consisting of discreet</p>
                <p><pb/>and wise men, men of business and talent, who <lb/>shall be above every influence here, and who <lb/>may be instructed to make inquiry into all the <lb/>sources of evil.</p>
