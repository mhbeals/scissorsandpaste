                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">The Penal Colonies.</hi></p>
                <p>Botany Bay serves as a recipient for criminals whose <lb/>reformation is hopeless, and whom it is therefore desir<lb break="no"/>able to remove from the Society to whose peace and se<lb break="no"/>curity they are sworn enemies. This is the sole value <lb/>of the colony. If it did not exist, recourse would be <lb/>had more frequently to perpetual imprisonment and the <lb/>gibbet. Experience shews, however, that transportation <lb/>does not produce the intended effect of terrifying the <lb/>guilty. Its monitory operation depends greatly on the <lb/>situation of the criminal. "Agricultural labourers <lb/>with families dread it extremely, while to single men, <lb/>mechanics who are sure of receiving high wages, and <lb/>generally to all those who feel a desire of change, and a <lb/>vague expectation of pushing their fortunes, it appears <lb/>to hold out no terrors whatever." In the colony there <lb/>is a competition among settlers to obtain convinct <lb/>servants, and those who get them, endeavour, from <lb/>a regard to their own interest to render the situation <lb/>of the convicts as little irksome as possible. The <lb/>evidence proves, that when the feeling degrada<lb break="no"/>tion is once overcome, the situation of the Australian <lb/>convict "is, in many respects, preferable to that of <lb/>the agricultural labourer in this country :" He <lb/>has better clothing, more abundant food, and en<lb break="no"/>joys a finer climate. The hardship, too, of compulsory <lb/>labour is but for a limited time. The convict who is <lb/>transported for 7 years, is allowed a Ticket of Leave, <lb/>at the end of 8years. Once possessed of this <lb/>ticket he is allowed to work on his own account, and <lb/>with high wages, easily acquires capital. The com<lb break="no"/>mittee see little chance of rendering punishment effec<lb break="no"/>tive in the colony. They recommend various subordi<lb break="no"/>nate regulations, and among others, they suggest as a <lb/>remedy for the great expense attending transportation, <lb/>that no convict be assigned to a settler until he shall <lb/>have paid, or given security for the payment by instal<lb break="no"/>ments, of the expense incurred in the conveyance of <lb/>the convict from the mother country.</p>
                <p>We are satisfied that the true check to the increase <lb/>of crime is to be found, first, in the diffusion of educa<lb break="no"/>tion and sound knowledge ; and, second, in the improve<lb break="no"/>ment of our judicial and municipal institutions. Law, <lb/>in all its important branches, should be dispensed by <lb/>paid and responsible persons. A judge ought to <lb/>be stationed in each small district, and keep open <lb/>court every day of the year. He should be chosen <lb/>by some popular constituency, which would faithfully <lb/>represent the feelings of the mass of suitors; and <lb/>as a guarantee for his diligence, he should hold his <lb/>office only for seven years, and be re-eligible. Jus<lb break="no"/>tices of Peace, if retained at all, should be elected <lb/>as in most of the American states, by the householders <lb/>for three, four, or seven years. Jails also, should be <lb/>placed under the controul of popular bodies, and thrown <lb/>open to the improving efforts of private benevolence. <lb/>In this, as in other points, we have much to learn from <lb/>the Americans, who never forget that the criminal is still <lb/>a man. The grand defect in our legislation has been, <lb/>that the rich made laws for the poor, of whose situation <lb/>they had scarcely any knowledge, and with whose feel<lb break="no"/>ings, wants, and moral condition, they had of course no <lb/>sympathy. The unpaid Magistracy of Britain is a bar<lb break="no"/>barism belonging to the tenth century. Thirty years <lb/>hence men will wonder how their forefathers tolerated <lb/>so monstrous a system.</p>
