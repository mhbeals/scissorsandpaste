                <p>The Rota frigate arrived on Monday off Ply<lb break="no"/>mouth, with a fleet from Halifax under convoy, and <lb/>passed up the channel with the chief part of the trade. <lb/>From the Hydra transport, which put into Plymouth, <lb/>we have received the following official notification of <lb/>Sir James Yeo's success on Lake Ontario, the Ame<lb break="no"/>rican notices of which have already been published.</p>

                <p>"Head-quarters Kingston, Aug. 14. 1813 <lb/>"By accounts received from his Excellency the <lb/>Governor in Chief and Commander of the forces, <lb/>from Commodore Sir James Yeo, dated off York, <lb/>half-past one P.M. on the 11th instant, the following <lb/>particulars have been transmitted of the capture and <lb/>loss of the enemy's armed schooners:–</p>
                <p>"On Thursday evening last, the 10th instant, <lb/>the enemy's squadron, under the Command of Com<lb break="no"/>modore Chauncey, got under weigh from their an<lb break="no"/>chorage, off the mouth of Niagara River, and, with <lb/>a fine breeze from the east, stood towards our fleet, <lb/>which were becalmed off the port of Twelve Mile <lb/>Creek. At sun-set, a breeze coming off the land, <lb/>gave us the wind of the enemy, when our squadron <lb/>stood for them, on which immediately bore away <lb/>from us under as much sail as their schooners could <lb/>carry to keep up with their larger vessels. The enemy's <lb/>fleet formed a long. The Pike, Madison, Oneida, <lb/>and six schooners (two schooners were placed to <lb/>windward for the purpose of raking the masts of our <lb/>squadron as it should come up). At eleven the <lb/>squadron got within gun-shot of the schooners, <lb/>when they opened a brisk fire, and, from their <lb/>going so fast, it was more than an hour before the <lb/>Wolf, our headmost ship, could pass them ; at <lb/>this time the rest of the squadron was two and <lb/>three miles astern of the Wolf, and on her coming <lb/>up with the Madison and Pike, they put before <lb/>the wind and made sail, firing their stern-chasers.– <lb/>Sir J. Yeo finding it impossible to get the squa<lb break="no"/>dron up with the enemy, as the Wolf was the only <lb/>ship which could keep up with them, then made <lb/>sail between them and the two schooners to wind<lb break="no"/>ward, which he captured, and which are called <lb/>the Julia and Growler, each carrying one long 32<lb break="no"/>pounder and long 12-pounder, and 40 men.– <lb/>Two of the enemy's largest schooners, the Scourge, <lb/>of 10, and Hamilton, of nine guns, upset on the <lb/>night of the 9th, in carrying sail, and all on board <lb/>perished (about 100 in number). By this loss and <lb/>capture, the enemy's squadron are reduced to 10 <lb/>vessels, and our's increased to eight. It is ascer<lb break="no"/>tained that the Pike mounts 28 long 24-pounders, <lb/>and 420 men, the Madison 22 long 32 pounders, <lb/>and 340 men. Boat loads of troops were taken on <lb/>board the enemy's squadron on Monday last, for the <lb/>purpose, it is supposed, of repelling the boarders.– <lb/>The Wolf has not received any material injury, and <lb/>not a person hurt. The prisoners were landed on <lb/>the 11th instant, and the Growler's damage repair<lb break="no"/>ed. She had lost her bowsprit, and was otherwise <lb/>cut up.</p>
                <p>"Nothing could exceed the eagerness and enthu<lb break="no"/>siasm of the officers and men in our squadron for a <lb/>close engagement."</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Attack on Fort Schlosser. </hi>
               <lb/>Head-quarters, Kingston, July 13.</p>
                <p>By accounts from the army under Major-General <lb/>De Rottenburg, dated the 9th instant, the following <lb/>particulars have been received of a bold and success<lb break="no"/>ful attempt to surprise the American post at Fort <lb/>Schlosser.</p>
                <p>In the night of the 4th instant, a party, consisting <lb/>of Volunteer Thompson and six privates of the 49th <lb/>regiment, under Ensign Winder, and thirty-four <lb/>of the militia, the whole under the command of Lieu<lb break="no"/>tenant Colonel Clarke, of the Lincoln militia, cros<lb break="no"/>sed over in boats from Chippawa to Fort Schlosser, <lb/>which they reached a little before day-break, and <lb/>completely surprised the guard, consisting of two <lb/>Lieutenants, one serjeant, and eight privates, whom <lb/>they made prisoners, together with three civilians <lb/>and three of our own subjects, found in the Fort.– <lb/>The party remained in the Fort about one hour, <lb/>loading their boats form the public stores and wharf, <lb/>and brought with them one brass six-pounder, 57 <lb/>stand of arms, two and a half kegs of musket ball <lb/>cartridges, 6 bulwarks of musket proof curtains for <lb/>boats, one gun-boat, two batteaux, 20 barrels of <lb/>salt, 17 casks tobacco, eight barrels of pork, and <lb/>one barrel of whiskey, with a number of spades, <lb/>oars, and axes ; a small party of the enemy had <lb/>collected as the last boast pushed off from the shore, <lb/>and several shots were fired, but the boats returned <lb/>to Chippawa with their prisoners, and the articles <lb/>they had captured, without a man being hurt on this <lb/>service. Further accounts have also been received <lb/>from the army highly creditable to the Indian war<lb break="no"/>riors serving with it. On the 8th instant, a party <lb/>of the King's regiment, and a body of Indian war<lb break="no"/>riors were sent to endeavour to recover a consider<lb break="no"/>able quantity of medicines and surgical instruments <lb/>which had been buried near the Fort George when <lb/>our troops retired from it. A skirmish ensued in <lb/>consequence between the Indians and the enemy, <lb/>in which the latter lost one officer and 20 men kil<lb break="no"/>led and 10 taken prisoners–the whole of the medi<lb break="no"/>cines and instruments were brought off by the party <lb/>of the King's; the only loss sustained being three In<lb break="no"/>dians wounded. Captain Norton led the Indian <lb/>warriors with great spirit ; and much credit is due <lb/>to Captain Merrit of the Provincial dragoons, for <lb/>reconnoitering the spot where the medicines were <lb/>deposited, and conducting the party to it.</p>
                <p>A few nights ago, the barracks at Gravelly Point <lb/>burnt by our gun-boats, and more than 100 <lb/>barrels of pork, flour, and other articles brought <lb/>away from thence, together with a very fine Durham <lb/>boat–500 oars colleced and partly loaded in her <lb/>for Sacket's Harbour, being destroyed.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Attack on Black Rock </hi>
               <lb/>Head-quarters, Kingston, July 15 1813.</p>
                <p>G. O.–His Excellency the Commander of the <lb/>forces has received a dispatch from Major General De <lb/>Rottenburg, reporting a successful attack upon the <lb/>enemy's post and dockyard at Black Rock at day<lb break="no"/>break on the morning of the 11th inst. by detach<lb break="no"/>ments of the King's and 41st regiments, together <lb/>with Liutenant Fitzgibbon's party of the 49th, and <lb/>about 40 militia, the whole amounting to 240 men, <lb/>under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp. <lb/>The enemy's position was carried by a spirited at<lb break="no"/>tack without the loss of a single man. Several large <lb/>boats, loaded with stores and provisions, and three <lb/>field pieces, a twelve and two six-pounders, were <lb/>brought away ; a vessel and all the naval store-houses <lb/>and barracks have been burnt.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately before the evacuation of the post was <lb/>completed, a strong reinforcement of the enemy, aid<lb break="no"/>ed by Indians, pressed this small detachment, <lb/>by which Captain Saunders, of the 41st, and 15 men, <lb/>were killed ; Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp, Lieutenant <lb/>Montpesson, of the 41st, and 15 rank and file, wound <lb/>ed. The wounded were brought over.</p>
                <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp has received three <lb/>wounds, severe, but not considered dangerous.</p>
                <p>By his Excellency's command,</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">British Expedition to Plattsburgh</hi>
            </p>
                <p>The following is an extract of a letter from a re<lb break="no"/>spectable citizen at Burlington, dated Aug. 1. 1813</p>
                <p>"An express arrived at Burlington on the 30th <lb/>July, with intelligence that the British had left the <lb/>Isle au Noix, with a force consisting of the two arm<lb break="no"/>ed sloops, of 11 guns each, and four gallies, of one <lb/>gun each, and 100 batteaux full of men, and had <lb/>progressed within one mile of the town. The camp <lb/>was instantly alarmed, and the troops under arms, <lb/>but no enemy appeared. Next day we learnt that <lb/>about 1000 troops, under the command of Colonel <lb/>Murray, had landed, and took possession of Platts<lb break="no"/>burgh without opposition, there being no force to op<lb break="no"/>pose them except the militia of the town and vicinity, <lb/>who being only 400 in number, retreated as the ene<lb break="no"/>my advanced. The arsenal belonging to the State, <lb/>Pike's encampment, barracks at Serenac cantonment, <lb/>and every building belonging to the United States, <lb/>were immediately burnt. The enemy obtained both <lb/>provisions and stores. The loss cannot be less than <lb/>50,000 dollars. The enemy left Plattsburgh on the <lb/>1st, and are understood to be proceeding this way <lb/>
               <supplied reason="copy blur"/> ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? <cb/>On General Dearborn invading Canada, and tak<lb break="no"/>ing possession of Fort George, he sent off to Green<lb break="no"/>bush, as prisoners of war, the following respectable <lb/>inhabitants : Messrs Edwards, Murehead, Dickson <lb/>Lyminston, Lawe, two Kerrs, M'Ewan, Parson <lb/>Addison, Howell, Heron, Green, Baldwin, Clinch <lb/>Jones, Ball, Decoe, and John Crook. Messrs <lb/>Lawe, M'Ewen and the two Kerrs were wounded <lb/>on the 27th June. General Dearborn expected <lb/>that the inhabitants would have joined the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans.</p>
                <p>General Dearborn resigned the command of the <lb/>Niagara army on the 23th June, on account of in<lb break="no"/>disposition. General Lewis says, in his dispatch to <lb/>Secretary at War, that he did not think the Ge<lb break="no"/>neral would ever again be fit for service ; that the <lb/>unfortunate events of the war had deranged his un<lb break="no"/>derstanding ; and that thought sometimes in a state <lb/>of convalescence, he uniformly relapsed when mili<lb break="no"/>tary topics were alluded to. General Lewis having <lb/>been nominated to command at Sacket's Har<lb break="no"/>bour, is succeeded at Fort George, Niagara, and on <lb/>the Canadian frontier, by General Boyd.</p>
                <p>The Indian chief, Tecumseh, has seized the fa<lb break="no"/>vourable moment of the diversion by our shipping in <lb/>Virginia, for surround Fort Meigs with 2000 <lb/>warriors. He had deprived the garrison of all the pos<lb break="no"/>sibility of receiving supplies. General Clay, who <lb/>commanded there, had written urgently to General <lb/>Harrison for assistance. The latter was collecting <lb/>his army to march to his relief.</p>
                <p>Sir James Yeo, after the retreat of the enemy's <lb/>army at Fort George, swept the American side of <lb/>Lake Ontario. He landed a body of troops at Great <lb/>Sodus, and took the whole of the provisions, con<lb break="no"/>sisting of several hundred barrels of pork and flour, <lb/>and burnt the buildings. The British loss was a <lb/>serjeant and four privates of the Royal killed. At <lb/>Genessee River, he inflicted the same loss on the <lb/>enemy, taking 500 barrels of pork and 1700 bushels <lb/>of corn. The provisions were delivered to General <lb/>Vincent. Four companies of the Royals were em<lb break="no"/>barked on board the fleet, to serve as mariners</p>
                <p>There were at Quebec, on the 22d July, 1000 <lb/>American prisoners of war, captured since the com<lb break="no"/>mencement of the campaign. At Beaufort there were <lb/>50 officers including three General. In consequence <lb/>of the conduct of the American Government and of <lb/>the officers, the latter are no longer permitted to re<lb break="no"/>turn home on parole. The Melpomene frigate, with <lb/>De Meuron's regiment, from the Mediterranean, <lb/>arrived in the river St. Lawrence on the 20th July.</p>
                <p>James Gready, private in the 8th, or King's regi<lb break="no"/>ment, and Terence Hunt, private in the 6th foot, <lb/>were in the latter end of June, tried by Court Mar<lb break="no"/>tials, for deserting to the enemy, and being found in <lb/>arms, and were publicy shot at Kingston, Canada, <lb/>pursuant to their sentence.</p>
                <p>It appears from the Quebec papers, and from the <lb/>general orders issued by the Commander in Chief in <lb/>Canada that on the late defeat of General Wilkin<lb break="no"/>son on the banks of the Miami river, the American <lb/>military chest, containing 15,000l. Sterling was a<lb break="no"/>mong the property captured by the British.</p>
                <p>Captain Waugh, of the 103d regiment, died at <lb/>Chamely on the 2d July.</p>
                <p>General Hampton has arrested Colonel Clark, the <lb/>late commandant at Burlington, for a defalcation of <lb/>about 50,000 dollars.</p>

                <p>By the Dunlop, Captain Abrams, arrived on Sun<lb break="no"/>day last, at Greenock, from Quebec, after a passage <lb/>of 36 days, papers and letters have been received from <lb/>Canada, to the 19th, which contain an amount of an <lb/>engagement between a detachment of the British <lb/>force under Lieut.-Col. Morrison, consisting of the <lb/>49th[?] and 89th regiments, with some companies of <lb/>the Canadian militia, and a body of American troops, <lb/>amounting to 4000 men, which ended in the defeat <lb/>of the latter, with great loss. This action was pro<lb break="no"/>duced by the attempt of the American General to <lb/>advance to Montreal, from which it appears, how<lb break="no"/>ever, he has now begun to measure back his steps, <lb/>having crossed to the American side of the river <lb/>where the action was fought, and being actively pur<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>sued in his retreat by the British troops.</p>
                <p>The following information has been received by <lb/>the Alexander, Captain Henry, which arrived at Li<lb break="no"/>verpool on Tuesday:–</p>
                <p>"Quebec, Nov. 26. 1813 <lb/>"The enemy's whole force was about 8000 men, <lb/>under the command of General Wilkinson. The <lb/>division commanded by General Boyd, consisting of <lb/>about 3000 to 4000 infantry, cavalry &amp;c. was alone <lb/>engaged upon the 11th instant.</p>
                <p>"The enemy lost in the action, Brigadier Gen. <pb/>Conington and Colonel Preston, killed–probably <lb/>600 men killed, wounded, and taken.</p>
                <p>"The consequence was a precipitate retreat across <lb/>the St Lawrence at Cornwall on the 13th, and eva<lb break="no"/>cuating the province. General Wilkinson marched <lb/>his troops into the Straits, the route of Plattsburgh, <lb/>leaving all his boats, upwards of 300, in the Salmon <lb/>river, where they were frozen in on the 16th, and <lb/>2000 men to protect them."</p>
                <p>Colonel Plenderleath came home in the Alexander, <lb/>with dispatches.</p>
