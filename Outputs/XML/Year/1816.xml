            </p>
                <p>A journey into the interior of New South Wales, across the <lb/>Blue Mountains, performed by his Excellency Colonel Mac <lb/>quarrie, Governor of the settlement. From the official ac<lb break="no"/>count, dated Sydney, June 10. 1815.</p>
                <p>The Governor desires to communicate, for the <lb/>information of the public, the result of his late <lb/>tour over the Western or Blue Mountains, un<lb break="no"/>dertaken for the purpose of being enabled per<lb break="no"/>sonally to appreciate the importance of the track <lb/>of country lying westward of them, which had <lb/>been explored in the latter end of the year 1813, <lb/>and beginning of 1814, by Mr George William <lb/>Evans, Deputy Surveyor of Lands.</p>
                <p>To those who know how very limited a track <lb/>of country has been hitherto occupied by the <lb/>colonists of New South Walves, extending along <lb/>the eastern coast to the north and south of Port <lb/>Jackson only 80 miles, and westward about 40 <lb/>miles, to the foot of that chain of mountains in <lb/>the interior which forms its western boundary, <lb/>it must be a subject of astonishment and regret, <lb/>that amongst so large a population no one ap<lb break="no"/>peared, within the first twenty-five years of the <lb/>establishment of this settlement, possessed of suf<lb break="no"/>ficient energy of mind to induce him fully to ex<lb break="no"/>plore a passage over these mountains ; but when <lb/>it is considered that for the greater part of that <lb/>time even this circumscribed portion of country <lb/>afforded sufficient produce for the wants of the <lb/>people, whilst on the other hand, the whole sur<lb break="no"/>face of the country beyond those limits was a <lb/>thick, and in many places, nearly an impene<lb break="no"/>trable forest, the surprise at the want of effort to <lb/>surmount such difficulties must abate very con<lb break="no"/>siderably.</p>
                <p>The records of the colony only afford two in<lb break="no"/>stances of any bold attempt having been made to <lb/>discover the country to the westward of the Blue <lb/>Mountains. The first was by Mr Bass, and the <lb/>other by Mr Caley, and both ended in disap<lb break="no"/>pointment; a cirumstance which will not be <lb/>much wondered at by those who have lately cross<lb break="no"/>ed these mountains.</p>
                <p>To Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth, <lb/>Esqrs. and Liutenant Lawson, of the Royal <lb/>veteran company, the merit is due of having, <lb/>with extraordinary patience and much fatigu, ef<lb break="no"/>fected the first passage over the most rugged and <lb/>difficult part of the Blue Mountains.</p>
                <p>The Governor being strongly impressed with <lb/>the importance of the object, had, early after his <lb/>arrival in this colony, formed the resolution of <lb/>encouraging the attempt to find a passage to the <lb/>western country, and willingly availed himself of <lb/>the facilities which the discoveries of these three <lb/>gentlemen afforded him. Accordingly, on the <lb/>20th of November 1813, he entrusted the ac<lb break="no"/>complishment of this object to Mr George Wil<lb break="no"/>liam Evans, deputy surveyor of lands, the result <lb/>of whose journey was laid before the public, <lb/>through the medium of the Sydney Gazette, on <lb/>the 12th of February, 1814.</p>
                <p>The favourable account given by Mr Evans <lb/>of the country he had explored, induced the <lb/>Governor to cause a road to be constructed for <lb/>the passage and conveyance of cattle and pro<lb break="no"/>visions to the interior ; and men of good cha<lb break="no"/>racter, from amongst a number of convicts who <lb/>had volunteered their services, were selected to <lb/>perform this arduous work, on condition of be<lb break="no"/>ing fed and clothed during the continuance of <lb/>their labour, and being granted emancipations <lb/>as their final reward on the completion of the <lb/>work.</p>
                <p>The direction and superintendence of this great <lb/>work was entrusted to William Cox. Esq. the <lb/>chief magistrate at Windsor ; and to the asto<lb break="no"/>nishment of every one who knows what was to be <lb/>encountered, and sees what has been done, he <lb/>effected its completion in six months from the <lb/>time of its commencement, happily without the <lb/>loss of a man, or any serious accident. The <lb/>Governor is at a loss to appreciate fully the <lb/>services rendered by Mr Cox to this colony, in <lb/>the execution of this arduous work, which pro<lb break="no"/>mises to be of the greatest public utility, by <lb/>opening a new source of wealth to the indus<lb break="no"/>trious and enterprising. When it is considered <lb/>that Mr Cox voluntarily relinquished the com<lb break="no"/>forts of his own house, and the society of his <lb/>numerous family, and exposed himself to much <lb/>personal fatigue, with only such temporary co<lb break="no"/>vering as the bark hut could afford from the in<lb break="no"/>clemency of the season, it is difficult to express <lb/>the sentiments of approbation to which such pri<lb break="no"/>vations and services are entitled.</p>
                <p>Mr Cox having reported the road as complet<lb break="no"/>ed on the 21st of January, the Governor, ac<lb break="no"/>companied by Mrs Macquarrie, and that gentle<lb break="no"/>man, commenced his tour on the 25th of April <lb/>last, over the Blue Mountains, and was joined <lb/>by Sir John Jamieson, at the Nepean, who ac<lb break="no"/>companied him during the entire tour. The fol<lb break="no"/>lowing gentlemen composed the Governor's suite: <lb/>Mr Campbell, Secretary ; Captain Antill, Ma<lb break="no"/>jor of Brigade ; Lieutenant Watts, Aide de<lb break="no"/>camp ; Mr Redfern, Assistant-Surgeon ; Mr <lb/>Oxley, Surveyor-General ; Mr Mehan, Deputy <lb/>Surveyor-General ; Mr Lewin, Painter and Na<lb break="no"/>turalist ; and Mr G. Evans, Deputy Surveyor of <lb/>lands, who had been sent forward for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of making further discoveries, and rejoined <lb/>the party on the day of arrival at Bathurst <lb/>Plains.</p>
                <p>The commencement of the ascent from Emu <lb/>Plains to the first depot, and thence to a resting <lb/>place, now called Spring Wood, distant twelve <lb/>miles from Emu Ford, was through a very hand<lb break="no"/>some open forests of lofty trees, and much more <lb/>practicable and easy than was expected. The <lb/>facility of the ascent for this distance excited <lb/>surprise, and is certainly not well calculated to <lb/>give the traveller a just idea of the difficulties he <lb/>has afterwards to encounter. At a further dis<lb break="no"/>stance of four miles a sudden change is perceiv<lb break="no"/>ed in the appearance of the timber and the qua<lb break="no"/>lity of the soil, the former becoming stunted, and <lb/>the latter barren and rocky. At this place, the <lb/>fatigues of the journey may be said to commence. <lb/>Here the country became altogether mountain<lb break="no"/>ous, and extremely rugged. Near to the 18th <lb/>mile (it is to be observed that the measure com<lb break="no"/>mences at Emu Ford), a pile of stones attracted <lb/>attention. It is close to the line of road, on the <lb/>top of a rugged and abrupt ascent, and is sup<lb break="no"/>posed to have been placed there by Mr Caley, as <lb/>the extreme limit of his tour. Hence the Go<lb break="no"/>vernor gave that part of the mountain the name <lb/>as Caley's[?] Repulse. To have penetrated even so <lb/>far was at that time an effort of no small difficul<lb break="no"/>ty. From henceforward to the 26th mile is a <lb/>succession of steep and rugged hills, some of <lb/>which are almost so abrupt as to deny a passage <lb/>altogether ; but at this place a considerable ex<lb break="no"/>tensive plain is arrived at, which constitutes the <lb/>summit of the western mountains ; and from <lb/>thence a most extensive and beautiful prospect <lb/>presents itself on all sides to the eye. The town <lb/>of Windsor, the river Hawkesbury, Prospect <cb/>Hill, and other objects within that part of the <lb/>colony now inhabited, of equal interest, are dis<lb break="no"/>tinctly seen from hence. The majestic gran<lb break="no"/>deur of the situation, combined with the various <lb/>objects to be seen from this place, induced the <lb/>Governor to give it the appellation of the King's <lb/>Table Land. On the south-west side of the <lb/>King's Table Land the mountain terminates in <lb/>abrupt precipices of immense depth, at the bot<lb break="no"/>tom of which is seen a glen, as romantically <lb/>beautiful as can be imagined, bounded on the <lb/>further side by mountains of great magnitude, <lb/>terminating equally abruptly as the others, and <lb/>the whole thickly covered with wood. The <lb/>length of this picturesque and remarkable track of <lb/>country is about 24 miles, to which the Go<lb break="no"/>vernor gave the name of the Prince Regent's <lb/>Glen. Proceeding hence to the thirty-third <lb/>mile, on the top of a hill, an opening presents <lb/>itself on the south-west side of the Prince <lb/>Regent's Glen, from whence a view is obtained <lb/>particularly beautiful and grand–mountains ris<lb break="no"/>ing beyond mountains, with stupendous masses <lb/>of rock in the fore ground, here strike the eye <lb/>with admiration and astonishment. The circular <lb/>form in which the whole is so wonderfully dis<lb break="no"/>posed induced the Governor to give the name of <lb/>Pitt's Amphitheatre (in honour of the Right <lb/>Hon. William Pitt) to this offset of branch from the <lb/>Prince Regent's Glen. The road continues from <lb/>hence for the space of 17 miles on the ridge of <lb/>the mountain which forms one side of the Prince <lb/>Regent's Glen, and there it suddenly terminates <lb/>in nearly a perpendicular precipice of 676 feet <lb/>high, as ascertained by measurement. The road <lb/>constructed by Mr Cox down this rugged and <lb/>tremendous descent, through all its windings, is <lb/>no less than three-fourths of a mile in length, <lb/>and has been executed with such skill and sta<lb break="no"/>bility as reflects much credit on him. The la<lb break="no"/>bour here undergone, and the difficulties sur<lb break="no"/>mounted, can only be appreciated by those who <lb/>view this scene. In order to perpetuate the me<lb break="no"/>mory of Mr Cox's services, the Governor deem<lb break="no"/>ed it a tribute justly due to him to give his name <lb/>to this grand and extraordinary pass, and he ac<lb break="no"/>cordingly called it Cox's Pass. Having descend<lb break="no"/>ed into a valley at the bottom of this pass, the <lb/>retrospective view of the overhanging mountain <lb/>is magnificently grand. Although the present <lb/>pass is the only practicable point yet discovered <lb/>for descending by, yet the mountain is much <lb/>higher than those on either side of it, from <lb/>whence it is distinguished at a considerable dis<lb break="no"/>tance, when approaching it from the interior, <lb/>and in this point of view it has the appearance <lb/>of a very high distinct hill, although it is in fact <lb/>only the abrupt termination of a ridge. The <lb/>Governor gave the name of Mount York to this <lb/>termination of the ridge, in honour of his Royal <lb/>Highness the Duke of York.</p>
                <p>On descending Cox' Pass, the Governor was <lb/>much gratified by the appearance of good pas<lb break="no"/>ture land and soil fit for cultivation, which was <lb/>the first he had met with since the commencement <lb/>of his tour. The valley at the base of Mount <lb/>York he called the Vale of Clwyd, in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of the strong resemblance it bore to the <lb/>vale of that name in North Wales. The grass <lb/>in this vale is of a good quality, and very [?]<lb break="no"/>dant, and a rivulet of fine water runs along it <lb/>from the eastward, which unites itself at the <lb/>western extremity of the vale with another ri<lb break="no"/>vulet containing still more water. The junction <lb/>of these two streams forms a very handsome river, <lb/>now called by the Governor, Cox's River, which <lb/>takes its course, as has been since ascertained <lb/>through the Prince Regent's Glen, and empties <lb/>itself into the river Nepean ; and it is conjec<lb break="no"/>tured, from the nature of the country through <lb/>which it passes, that it mut be one of the prin<lb break="no"/>cipal causes of the floods which have been occa<lb break="no"/>sionally felt on the low banks of the river Hawkes<lb break="no"/>bury, into which the Nepean discharges itself. <lb/>The Vale of Clwyd, from the base of Mount <lb/>York, extends six miles in a westerly direction, <lb/>and has its termination at Cox's River. West<lb break="no"/>ward of this river the country again becomes <lb/>hilly, but it is generally open forest land, and <lb/>very good passage.</p>
                <p>Three miles to the westward of the Vale of <lb/>Clwyd, Messrs Blaxland, Wentworth, and Law<lb break="no"/>son, had formerly terminated their excursion ; <lb/>and when the various difficulties are consider<lb break="no"/>ed which they had to contend with, especially <lb/>until they had effected the descent from Mount <lb/>York, to which place they were obliged to pass <lb/>through a thick brush-wood, where they were <lb/>under the necessity of cutting a passage for <lb/>their baggage horses, the severity of which <lb/>labour had seriously affected their healths, <lb/>their patient endurance of such fatigue cannot <lb/>fail to excite much surprise and admiration. <lb/>In commemoration of their merits, three beauti<lb break="no"/>ful high hills, joining each other at the end of <lb/>their tour at this place, have receieved their <lb/>names in the following order, viz. Mount Blax<lb break="no"/>land, Wentworth's Sugar Loaf, and Lawson's <lb/>Sugar Load. A range of very lofty hills and <lb/>narrow vallies alternately form the track of <lb/>country from Cox's River, for a distance of 16 <lb/>miles, until the Fish River is arrived at ; and the <lb/>stage between these rivers is consequently very <lb/>severe and oppressive on the cattle. To this <lb/>range the Governor gave the name of Clarence <lb/>Hilly Range.</p>
                <p>Proceeding from the Fish River, and at a short <lb/>distance from it, a very singular and beautiful <lb/>mountain attracts the attentions, its summit be<lb break="no"/>ing crowned with a large and very extraordinary <lb/>looking rock, nearly circular in form, which <lb/>gives the whole very much the appearance of <lb/>a hill fort, such as are frequent in India. To <lb/>this lofty hill Mr Evans, who was the first Eu<lb break="no"/>ropean discoverer, gave the name of Mount <lb/>Evans. Passing on from hence the country con<lb break="no"/>tinues hilly, but affords good pasturage, gradu<lb break="no"/>ally improving to Sidmouth Valley, which is <lb/>distant from the pass of the Fish RIver eight <lb/>miles. The land here is level, and the first met <lb/>with unencumbered with timber. It is not of <lb/>very considerable extent, but abounds with a <lb/>great variety of herbs and plants, such as would <lb/>probably highly interest and gratify the scientific <lb/>botanist. The beautiful little valley runs north<lb break="no"/>west and south-east, between hills of easy ascent, <lb/>thinly covered with timber. Leaving Sidmouth <lb/>Valley, the country becomes again hilly, and in <lb/>other respects resembles very much the country <lb/>to the eastward of the valley for some miles. <lb/>Having reached Campbell River, distant 13 miles <lb/>from Sidmouth Valley, the Governor was high<lb break="no"/>ly gratified by the appearance of the country, <lb/>which there began to exhibity an open and ex<lb break="no"/>tensive view of gently rising grounds and fertile <lb/>plains. Judging from the height of the banks, <lb/>and its general width, the Campbell River must <lb/>be on some occasions of very considerable mag<lb break="no"/>nitude ; but the extraordinary drought which <lb/>has apparently prevailed on the western side of <lb/>the mountains, equally as throughout this colony <cb/>for the last three years, has reduced this river <lb/>so much, that it may be more properly called a <lb/>chain of pools than a running stream at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time. In the reaches or pools of the Camp<lb break="no"/>bell River, the very curious animal called the <lb/>Paradox, or Water Mole, is seen in great num<lb break="no"/>bers. The soil on both banks is uncommonly <lb/>rich, and the grass is consequently luxuriant. <lb/>Two miles to the southward of the line of road <lb/>which crosses the Campbell River, there is a <lb/>very fine rich track of low lands, which has been <lb/>named Mitchell Plains. Flax was found here <lb/>growing in considerable quanities. The Fish <lb/>River, which forms a junction with the Campbell <lb/>River a few miles to the northward of the road <lb/>and bridge over the latter, has also two very <lb/>fertile plains on its banks, the one called O'Con<lb break="no"/>nel Plains, and the other Macquarrie Plains, both <lb/>of considerable extent, and very capable of yield<lb break="no"/>ing all the necessities of life.</p>
                <p>At the distance of seven miles from the bridge <lb/>over the Campbell River, Bathurst Plains open <lb/>to the view, presenting a rich track of cham<lb break="no"/>paign country of 11 miles in length, bounded on <lb/>both sides by gently rising and very beautiful <lb/>hills, thinly wooded. The Macquarrie River, <lb/>which is constituted by the junction of the Fish <lb/>and Campbell River, takes a winding course <lb/>through the Plains, which can be easily traced <lb/>from the high lands ajoining, by the particular <lb/>verdure of the trees on its banks, which are like<lb break="no"/>wise the only trees throughout the extent of the <lb/>plains. The level and clean surface of these <lb/>plains gives them at first view very much the <lb/>appearance of lands in a state of cultivation.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to behold this grand scene <lb/>without a feeling of admiration and surprise, <lb/>whilst the silence and solitude which reign in a <lb/>space of such extent and beauty as seems design<lb break="no"/>ed by Nature for the occupancy and comfort of <lb/>man created a degree of melancholy in the mind <lb/>which may be more easily imagined than de<lb break="no"/>scribed.</p>
                <p>The Governor and suite arrived at these Plains <lb/>on Thursday the 4th of May, and encamped on <lb/>the southern or left bank of the Macquarrie <lb/>River–the situation being selected in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of its commanding a beautiful and exten<lb break="no"/>sive prospect for many miles in every direction <lb/>around it. At this place the Governor remained <lb/>for a week, which time he occupied in making <lb/>excursions in different directions through the <lb/>adjoining country, on both sides the river.</p>
                <p>On Sunday, the 7th of May, the Governor <lb/>fixed on a site suitable for the erection of a town <lb/>at some future period, to which he gave the name <lb/>of Bathurst, in honour of the present Secretary <lb/>of State for the Colonies. The situation of Ba<lb break="no"/>thurst is elevated sufficiently beyond the reach <lb/>of any floods which may occur, and is at the <lb/>same time so near to the river on its south bank <lb/>as to derive all the advantages of its clear and <lb/>beautiful stream. The mechanics and settlers of <lb/>whatever description who may be hereafter per<lb break="no"/>mitted to form permanent residences to them<lb break="no"/>selves at this place will have the highly import<lb break="no"/>ant advantages of a rich and fertile soil, with a <lb/>beautiful river flowing through it, for all the uses <lb/>of man. The Governor mut however add, that <lb/>the hopes which were once so sanguinely enter<lb break="no"/>tained of this river becoming navigable to the <lb/>Western Sea have ended in disappointment.</p>
                <p>During the week that the Governor remained <lb/>at Bathurst he made daily excursions in various <lb/>directions ; one of these extended 22 miles in a <lb/>south-west direction, and on that occasion, as <lb/>well as on all the others, he found the country <lb/>chiefly composed of vallies and plains, separated <lb/>occasionally by ranges of low hills; the soil <lb/>throughout being generally fertile, and well cir<lb break="no"/>cumstanced for the purpose of agriculture or <lb/>grazing.</p>
                <p>The Governor here feels much pleasure in be<lb break="no"/>ing enabled to communicate to the public that <lb/>the favourable reports which he had received of <lb/>the country to the west of the Blue Mountains <lb/>have not been by any means exaggerated. The <lb/>difficulties which present themselves in the jour<lb break="no"/>ney from hence are certainly great and inevi<lb break="no"/>table, but thsoe persons who may be inclined to <lb/>become permanent settlers there will probably con<lb break="no"/>tent themselves withvisiting this part of the colony <lb/>but rarely, and of course will have them seldom <lb/>to encounter. Plenty of water, and a sufficien<lb break="no"/>cy of grass are to be found in the mountains for <lb/>the support of such cattle as may be sent over <lb/>them ; and the tracks of fertile soil and rich pas<lb break="no"/>turage which the new country affords are fully <lb/>extensive enough for any increase of population <lb/>and stock which can possibly take place for ma<lb break="no"/>ny years.</p>
                <p>Within a distance of ten miles from the site of <lb/>Bathurst there is not less than 50,000 acres of <lb/>land clear of timber, and fully one half of that <lb/>may be considered excellent soil, well calculated <lb/>for cultivation. It is a matter of regrets that in <lb/>proportion as the soil improves the timber dege<lb break="no"/>nerates ; and it is to be remarked, that every<lb break="no"/>where to the westward of the mountains it is <lb/>much inferior both in size and quality to that <lb/>within the present colony ; there is, however, a <lb/>sufficiency of timber of tolerable quality within <lb/>the district around Bathurst for the purposes of <lb/>house-building and husbandry.</p>
                <p>The Governor has here to lament that neither <lb/>coals nor limestone have been yet discovered in <lb/>the western country ; articles in themselves of <lb/>so much importance, that the want of them must <lb/>be severely felt whenever that country shall <lb/>be settled.</p>
                <p>Having enumerated the principal and most im<lb break="no"/>portant features of this new country, the Gover<lb break="no"/>nor has now to notice some of its live produc<lb break="no"/>tions. All around Bathurst abounds in a variety <lb/>of game ; and the two principal rivers contain a <lb/>great quantity of fish, but all of one denomina<lb break="no"/>tion, resembling the perch in appearance, and of <lb/>a delicate and fine flavour, not unlike that of a <lb/>rock cod. This fish grows to a large size, and <lb/>is very voracious. Several of them were caught <lb/>during the Governor's stay at Bathurst, and at <lb/>the halting place on the Fish River. One of <lb/>those caught weight 17 lb ; and the people <lb/>stationed at Bathurst stated that they had caught <lb/>some weighing 25 lb.</p>
                <p>The field game are the kangaroos, emus, black <lb/>swans, wild geese, wild turkies, bustards, ducks <lb/>of various kinds, quail, bronze, and other pi<lb break="no"/>geons, &amp;c. &amp;c. The water mole, or paradox, <lb/>also abounds in all the rivers and ponds.</p>
                <p>The site designed for the towns of Bathurst, by <lb/>observation taken at the Flag Staff, which was <lb/>erected on the day of Bathurst receiving that <lb/>name, is situated in latitude 33. 24. 30. south, <lb/>being also 27 1/2 miles north of Government House, <lb/>In Sydney, and 94 1/2 west of it, bearing west 20. <lb/>30. north, 83 geographic miles, or 95 1/2 statute <lb/>miles ; the measured road distance from Sydney <lb/>to Bathurst being 140 English miles.</p>
                <p>The road constructed by Mr Cox, and the <cb/>party under him, commences at Emu Ford, on <lb/>the left bank of the river Nepean, and is thence <lb/>carried 101 1/2 miles to the flag staff at Bathurst. <lb/>This road has been carefully measured, and each <lb/>mile regularly marked on the trees growing on <lb/>the left side of the road proceeding towards Ba<lb break="no"/>thurst.</p>
                <p>The Governor in his tour made the following <lb/>stages, in which he was principally regulated by <lb/>the consideration of having good pasturage for <lb/>the cattle, and plenty of water :–</p>
                <p>1st stage–Spring Wood, distant from Emu Ford 12 miles <lb/>2d stage ditto–Jamieson's Valley, or 2d depot, distant <lb/>from ditto . . . . . . . . . . 28 <lb/>3d ditto–Blackheath, distant from ditto . . . 41 <lb/>4th ditto–Cox's River, distant from ditto . . .56 <lb/>5th ditto–The Fish River, distant from ditto . 72 <lb/>6th ditto–Sidmouth Valley, distant from ditto . 80 <lb/>7th ditto–Campbell River, distant from ditto . 91 <lb/>8th ditto–Bathurst distant from ditto . . . 101 1/2</p>
                <p>At all of which places the traveller may as<lb break="no"/>sure himself of good grass, and water in abun<lb break="no"/>dance.</p>
                <p>On Thursday, the 11th of May, the Gover<lb break="no"/>nor and suite set out from Bathurst on their <lb/>return, and arrived at Sidney on Friday the <lb/>19th Ult.</p>
                <p>The Governor deems it expedient here to no<lb break="no"/>tify to the public, that he does not mean to make <lb/>any grants of land to the westward of the Blue <lb/>Mountains, until he shall receive the commands <lb/>of his Majesty's Ministers on that subject, and <lb/>in reply to the report he is now about to make <lb/>them upon it.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, such gentlemen or other <lb/>respectable free persons as may wish to visit this <lb/>new country will be permitted to do so, on mak<lb break="no"/>ing a written application to the Governor to that <lb/>effect, who will order them to be furnished with <lb/>written passes. It is at the same time strictly or<lb break="no"/>dered and directed that no person, whether civil <lb/>or military, shall attempt to travel over the Blue <lb/>Mountains without having previously applied for <lb/>and obtained permission, in the above prescribed <lb/>form. The military guard stationed at the first <lb/>depot on the mountains will receive full instruc<lb break="no"/>tions to prevent the progress of any persons who <lb/>shall not have obtained regular passes. The ne<lb break="no"/>cessity for the establishing and strictly enforcing <lb/>this regulation is too obvious to every one <lb/>who will reflect on it to require any explanation <lb/>here.</p>
                <p>The Governor cannot conclude this account <lb/>of his tour, without offering his best ackow<lb break="no"/>ledgements to William Cox, Esq. for the impor<lb break="no"/>tant services he has rendered to the colony in so <lb/>short a period of time, by opening a passage to <lb/>the new discovered country, and at the same time <lb/>assuring him that he shall have great pleasure in <lb/>recommending his meritorious services on this <lb/>occasion to the favourable consideration of his <lb/>Majesty's Ministers.</p>

            </p>
                <p>Montreal, Oct. 5. <lb/>On the afternoon of Saturday last, the specie <lb/>seized on board the Lake Champlain steam-boat, <lb/>amounting to upward of 12,000 dollars, arrived <lb/>at his Majesty's cash-office here, under the es<lb break="no"/>cort of the 19th light dragoons from St John's.</p>
                <p>At length we have authentic accounts relating <lb/>to the expedition of Lord Selkirk ; they are very <lb/>important, as many <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi>  details have been <lb/>published - his taking Fort William by storm, <lb/>making all the partners of the North West Com<lb break="no"/>pany prisoners, &amp;c. ; but the cause of the expe <lb/>dition has never been explained. The Canadian <lb/>Courant puts it in a very clear point of view:– <lb/>Mr Robert Semple, the Governor-General <lb/>The Hudson's Bay Company on the Red River, <lb/>towards the close of the year 1815, took posses<lb break="no"/>sion of two establishments belonging to the North <lb/>West Company, which had obtruded themselves <lb/>on the territory of the Hudson's Bay Company. <lb/>The North West traders then altered their <lb/>route, going into the Upper Country by circuit<lb break="no"/>ous ways, by which much delay took place ; and <lb/>in order to try Mr Semple, they sent two cart<lb break="no"/>loads of provisions by the former track in June <lb/>last, with a guard of fifty men ; the advance, <lb/>twenty-two of the number, fell in with one of <lb/>the natives, whom they took forward with them <lb/>to prevent discovery. The rear-guard passed <lb/>within four miles of the settlement ; they were <lb/>perceived by the Governor, and were attacked <lb/>by a party from the garrison, consisting of about <lb/>thirty soldiers ; an engagement took place, stat<lb break="no"/>ed on the 19th of June. Mr Semple and 21 <lb/>of his men were killed ; the rest of his forces <lb/>returned defeated to the fort ; it is on this ac<lb break="no"/>count that the expedition of Lord Selkirk was <lb/>undertaken. The manner of Lord Selkirk's con<lb break="no"/>ducting the expedition we do not justify, nor in<lb break="no"/>deed can we form any opinion on the subject <lb/>without further authentic details ; it is, however, <lb/>but justice to say, that the Hudson's Bay Com<lb break="no"/>pany have rights, and are a chartered Company ; <lb/>the North West Traders, though we believe a <lb/>most respectable body, are only an Association <lb/>of Merchants.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Canada  <lb/>Lord Selkirk</hi>
            </p>
                <p>We have been favoured by a Gentleman in this city, with the <lb/>following interesting and authentic communication, on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of the dispute between Lord Selkirk, and the Gentlemen of <lb/>the North West Company:</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Extract of a Letter from Montreal, dated 6th October, </hi>
               <lb/>1816.</p>
                <p>"In the newspapers which I sent you, you will see some <lb/>accounts of the disturbances which have taken place in the North <lb/>West between the North West Company and Lord Selkirk's co<lb break="no"/>lonists. The latter have been obliged to leave the Red River, <lb/>after having had 22 of their men, including Governor Semple, <lb/>killed by a party of <hi rend="italic">half-breeds,</hi>  the spurious offspring of the <lb/>North West Company. As yet have not had an accurate <lb/>statement of that melancholy transaction. Lord Selkirk's party <lb/>state that these half-breed with some of the North West Com<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>pany servants, came to destroy the settlement, and that Mr <lb/>Semple, with about 25 of the Colonists, went out to meet them, <lb/>to know what could be their intentions, when those rascals com<lb break="no"/>menced firing on them, and massacred all but three, who were for<lb break="no"/>tunate enough to make their escape. The North West people's <lb/>account is that these <hi rend="italic">half-breeds</hi>  with some <hi rend="italic">Indians</hi>  were bring<lb break="no"/>ing down provisions from the upper part of the Red River to the <lb/>entrance near Lake Winipie, and as the Colonists had the com<lb break="no"/>mand of a great part of the river, they were obliged to pass in the <lb/>rear of the settlement, which being observed by Governor Sem<lb break="no"/>ple, who was on the look-out for them, he settled out of his Fort <lb/>with 25 men and a [?]-piece to take from the Indians the pro<lb break="no"/>visions which were intended for the North West Company ; that <lb/>the result[?] was an engagement which terminated in the defeat of <lb/>the Colonists, of whom twenty-two were killed. Lord Selkirk <lb/>[?] from Montreal for the Red River about the latter end of <lb/>June, when[?] three or four officers and about 150 men of De Men<lb break="no"/>[?]'s regiment, which had been disbanded, and when he arrived <lb/>at Fort William on Lake Superior, hearing the fate of his Colon<lb break="no"/>ists, he[?] immediately issued a warrant against Mr M'Gillivray for <lb/>high treason, conspiracy and murder, and subsequently warrants a<lb break="no"/>gainst all the partners of the N. W. Company, who were at F Wil<lb break="no"/>liam, [?] formal possession of their establishment there, and sent <lb/>Mr M'Gillivray, with about ten others, prisoners to Montreal, with <lb/>all their papers [?] a number of packs of Beaver and other Furs, <lb/>and several bales[?] of Merchandise, which he found in possession of <lb/>the North West Company, belonging to the Hudson's Bay Com<lb break="no"/>pany. The Police Officers in Montreal were several days exa<lb break="no"/>mining the papers, and about four or five days after the arrival of <lb/>Mr M'Gillivray and the others, they were admitted to bail, to ap<lb break="no"/>pear to take their trial at the next criminal court, or any court of <lb/>Oyer and Terminer which may be appointed. Stuart (the ci-de<lb break="no"/> vant Solicitor-General, who was dismissed by Sir James Craig, <lb/>and at whose instance an ineffectual attempt was lately made by <lb/>some misguided members of our House of Assembly to impeach <lb/>Chief Justices Sewell and Monk) is one of Lord Selkirk's coun<lb break="no"/>sel and spoke at great length, and what his friends and admi<lb break="no"/>rers call very eloquently, strongly opposed their being admitted <lb/>to bail, but all would not do, and they were accordingly bailed ; <lb/>Mr M'Gillivray in sureties of t1000 and the others in t500, <lb/>sums inconsiderable enough, advering to the high crimes and <lb/>misdemeanours with which they were charged.</p>
                <p>"In the <hi rend="italic">Montreal Herald</hi>  you will see a very learned, and (as <lb/>our neighbour Jonathan would say) a <hi rend="italic">lengthy</hi>  communication, <lb/>signed <hi rend="italic">Montius[?]</hi>, setting forth the rights which the Hudson's <lb/>Bay Company by their charter possess over the Countries which <lb/>they have granted to Lord Selkirk, and the power vested in him <lb/>of appointing Governors and other Officers to superintend and <lb/>regulate the Colony. Being a masterly production, it will no <lb/>doubt makes its appearance in a pamphlet, and when it does, I <lb/>shall send you one, in case the papers should miscarry. It is un<lb break="no"/>certain whether the Earl will remain in the North West during <lb/>the winter, or come down to Montreal ; if the latter, he must be <lb/>down[?] soon[?], as the season for water-travelling will shortly close.</p>
                <p>"Montreal is now divided into two parties, one favouring the <lb/>Lord, and the other the North West Company ; and with the ex<lb break="no"/>ception of the friends of the latter, strongly in favour of his <lb/>Lordship."</p>
