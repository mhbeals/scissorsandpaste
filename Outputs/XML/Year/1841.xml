               <pb/>On Monday a discussion of some interest took <lb/>place in the House of Commons relative to the <lb/>affairs of South Australia. Owing to certain de<lb break="no"/>fects in its government, that colony has fallen <lb/>into a state of financial embarassment requiring <lb/>immediate relief. Lord John Russell traced the <lb/>history of the settlement from its foundation, and <lb/>stated that, while its revenue does not exceed <lb/>t20,000 its expenditure has increased to the <lb/>enormous sum of t130,000 a year ! At present <lb/>its affairs are managed by commissioners, the re<lb break="no"/>sponsible Ministers of the Crown having no di<lb break="no"/>rect control over its expenditure. This is mani<lb break="no"/>festly an evil, and must form the subject of future <lb/>legislation, but in the meantime it is necessary to <lb/>provide for the payment of certain bills now <lb/>over-due. Accordingly, Lord John Russell pro<lb break="no"/>posed that her Majesty should be authorized to <lb/>guarantee a loan of t210,000 for this purpose. <lb/>Lord Stanley concurred generally in the views of <lb/>the noble Secretary for the Colonies, but though <lb/>that the Government ought not to demand a <lb/>loan until they had brought in a bill to explain <lb/>distinctly the principles on which they proposed <lb/>that the colony should henceforth be governed. <lb/>Sir Robert Peel suggested that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should ask a vote of credit for the sum re<lb break="no"/>quired, which, as it met the urgency of the case, <lb/>was ultimately agreed upon, and the subject was <lb/>deferred till Friday.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Grote</hi>  rose to move a series of resolutions in con<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>demnation of the application of a part of the Land and Emi<lb break="no"/>gration Fund of New South Wales to the maintenance of <lb/>gaols and police in that colony. It was in 1831 that this ex<lb break="no"/>pense, antecedently borne by the Home Government, was <lb/>for the first time thrown upon the colony, whose revenues <lb/>were then found to yield considerable surplus of revenue <lb/>beyond expenditure. The charge so imposed at that time was <lb/>calculated to be about t25,000 a year ; and had that been all <lb/>the colony would have borne it without a murmur; but in <lb/>fact it had ever since averaged nearly t60,000. It was not <lb/>reasonable to impose such a charge on the colony, on account <lb/>of gaols and police, constituted not the ordinary uses of <lb/>a colonial society, but for the peculiar purposes of our trans<lb break="no"/>portation system. The argument urged by the Home Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was, that the expense was chiefly caused by the extensive <lb/>distribution of convicts by assignment throughout the colony, <lb/>whose settlers drew a proportional profit from the labour so <lb/>assigned. But that assignment was a gain, not more to the <lb/>colonists, who obtained the labour, than to the mother country, <lb/>which saved the expense of maintaing the labourers. What<lb break="no"/>ever value the mother country might be entitled to claim <lb/>for the labour of the convicts, ought in strictness to fall, not <lb/>on the colony at large, but on the individual employers; and <lb/>if there were valid reasons against an exaction of premium <lb/>from them, still it was unjust to throw the obligation upon <lb/>the colony at large. That was to pay private wages out of <lb/>public rates. This one charge on the oclony was sufficient <lb/>on account for all that embarassment in its finances which <lb/>had been growing for the last six years. It had been enabled <lb/>to defray the impact, only by resorting to the emigra<lb break="no"/>tion fund, and thus checking emigration itself. No <lb/>less than t260,000 had been abstracted from that fund to <lb/>meet these costs of jails and police. The diversion of that <lb/>fund from emigration was a great evil, both to the colony, <lb/>where labour is so pressingly needed, and to the poor of this <lb/>country, to whom that refuge is so material. He considered <lb/>the emigration fund as held by the Government in trust for <lb/>the united intersts of the colony and of the mother country. <lb/>The great extent of sales of land in the colony had been <lb/>[?] owing to the belief of the colonists that the proceed<lb break="no"/>[?] would be applied to emigration.</p>
                <p>The hon. member was proceeding to cite the opinions of <lb/>various persons in favour of this strict application, when a mo<lb break="no"/>tion was made to count the House, and it adjourned for want <lb/>of its quorum[?] of 40 members.</p>

            </head>
                <p>We have received a copy of a Series of Resolu<lb break="no"/>tions passed, on the 23d of October 1840, by the <lb/>Legislative Council of New South Wales, on the <lb/>subject of immigration into colony. The <lb/>object of these resolutions is to encourage emigra<lb break="no"/>tion from the mother country, by showing the <lb/>demand for labour in New South Wales, and the <lb/>advantages offered to the immigrant. We have <lb/>only room for a few of the more important resolu<lb break="no"/>tions :</p>
                <p>Resolved. That there exists throughout the colony <lb/>an urgent and increasing want of working hands, in <lb/>every branch of industry ; that there is ample employ<lb break="no"/>ment for emigrants, at highly renumerating wages <lb/>without the interruption, in this mild climate, experi<lb break="no"/>enced in colder countries during the winter months ; <lb/>and that, even during the worst period of the past <lb/>severe drought, no persons able and willing to work <lb/>found any difficult in procuring advantageous employ<lb break="no"/>ment.</p>
                <p>Resolved. That, in the opinion of this Council, there <lb/>can be no more advantageous field for the employment <lb/>of industry than is presented in New South Wales– <lb/>experience proving, that able-bodied, sober, indus<lb break="no"/>trious and careful emigrants may, within a few years <lb/>after their arrival, rise form the condition of labourers <lb/>to be themselves employers of labour; by which pro<lb break="no"/>cess, and by the progressive increase of the flocks and <lb/>herds of the colony, a constant demand for additional <lb/>labourers is created, sufficient to remove all apprehen<lb break="no"/>sion of a dearth of employment for as many as may <lb/>arise.</p>
                <p>Resolved. That this Council would particularly in<lb break="no"/>stance the large and increasing sums at the credit of <lb/>the working classes in the Savings Bank of New South <lb/>Wales, as affording gratifying evidence of their pros<lb break="no"/>perous condition, the deposits having increased from <lb/>t24,469, the amount on 31st December 1835, to t127,000 <lb/>on 31st August 1840.</p>
                <p>Resolved. That great additional advantage must <lb/>accrue to the mother country from the large consump<lb break="no"/>tion in this colony of British produce and manufac<lb break="no"/>tures, the declared value of which, from 1826 to 1839, <lb/>according to the official returns for that period, <lb/>amounted to more than eight millions sterling, having <lb/>progressively increased from t280,000, the amount in <lb/>1826, to t1,251,969 in 1839 ; whilst the exports from <lb/>the colony, including the produce of the fisheries, in<lb break="no"/>creased from t106,600 in the former year, to t948,776 <lb/>in the latter–the total amount being t6,187,530 for the <lb/>whole period.</p>
                <p>Resolved. That the trade between the mother coun<lb break="no"/>try and this colony, together with the whale fisheries <lb/>in the adjourning seas, also affords a valuable nursery <lb/>for seamen, important in this respect, in proportion to <lb/>the distance from Great Britain, and calculated to <lb/>strengthen and secure her maritime power ; and that <lb/>this field for the employment of British shipping must <lb/>increase with the growing prosperity of the colony– <lb/>considerations which appear to this Council to consti<lb break="no"/>tute a strong additional claim, on the part of the colony, <lb/>to the fostering care of the British Government.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to New Zealand.</hi> –On Friday the <lb/>Tyne left the London Dock, and proceeded down the <lb/>river on her voyage to Port Nicholson, New Zealand. <lb/>The Tyne is a fine new vessel, and she takes out 50 <lb/>mechanics and labourers, with their families, from the <lb/>Emigration Depot at Deptford, besides a number of <lb/>other passengers, amongst whom are Mr Swainson, <lb/>Chief Justice, and Mr Martin, Attorney-General, of <lb/>the new colony, to which sations they have been re<lb break="no"/>cently appointed. The arrangements for the comfort <lb/>of the emigrants on board were certainly very com<lb break="no"/>plete ; and it must be gratifying to know that those <lb/>persons sent out by the company will be provided <lb/>with a large proportion of their provisions fresh, a <lb/>great quantity of patent preserved provisions being <lb/>shipped for that purpose on board the Tyne. There <lb/>are a greater number of children than usual in the <lb/>Emigration Depot–many of the families consisting of <lb/>from eight to twelve individuals. The Prince Rupert, <lb/>which now lies in the London Dock, will clear out on <lb/>the 10th inst ; and it is supposed she will pretty well <lb/>clear the depot of its present inmates.</p>

                <p>A very lively and interesting scene occurred on Fri<lb break="no"/>day, off the West India Dock entrance, at Blackwall, <lb/>by the preparation for departure of three fine vessels <lb/>with "improvers" for "Nelson," the second colony of <lb/>New Zealand. The Directors of the Company and <lb/>several hundred persons of rank and wealth met there <lb/>to bid farewell to the enterprising emigrants, who ap<lb break="no"/>peared highly delighted with the honour extended to <lb/>them, and in high spirits with the anticipations of the <lb/>successful result of their mission. After viewing the <lb/>arrangeents made for the comfort of all on board, <lb/>the Directors returned to the West India Dock Tavern, <lb/>where a sumptuous breakfast was provided in the large <lb/>room. The Duke of Sussex took the chair, and was <lb/>supported on the right by the Earl of Devon, and on <lb/>the left by Jos. Somes, Esq., the Governor of the Com<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>pany. Among the guests were the Duchess of Inver<lb break="no"/>ness, the Duke and Duchess of Somerset, Lords Cot<lb break="no"/>tenham, Sandon, Marcus Hill, Clements, Viscount <lb/>Ebrington, M.P., the Hon. Frederick Dundas, Hon. <lb/>Captain Drummon, Messrs P. Maxwell Stewart, M.P., <lb/>Gowen, G. F. Young, W. C. Young, and the Misses <lb/>Young; the Hon. Mrs Douglas, the Hon. Miss Petre, <lb/>Rev, Dr Hinds, J. E. Boulcott, Captain Hine, Sir Ro<lb break="no"/>bert and Lady Harland, Sir John Doxatt, M. D.; Mr, <lb/>Mrs, and Miss Pennington; Lieutenant Lean, her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's Emigration Agent; MEssrs Jordan, E. G. Wake<lb break="no"/>field, Dudley Costello, Mr and Mrs S. C. Brees, Captain <lb/>Sinclair, R.N.,&amp;c. &amp;c. The rapid progress which the <lb/>grand undertaking of colonizing New Zealand has <lb/>made, was more than once alluded to by his Royal <lb/>Highness and other distinguished speakers on both <lb/>sides of politics, and its many advantages were dwelt <lb/>upon with much sincerity of feeling. Several gentle<lb break="no"/>men of the first families go out with this expedition, <lb/>which will be closely followed by several first-rate <lb/>ships.</p>

                <p>A Return, just published, shows that emigra<lb break="no"/>tion is still proceeding upon a gigantic scale:–</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigrants from the United Kingdom in 1840. </hi>
               <lb/>England. Scotland. Ireland. Total. <lb/>To North American <lb/>colonies, 5,303 3,053 23,935 32,293 <lb/>United States, 35,309 1,246 4,087 40,0 <lb/>Other parts of Ame<lb break="no"/>rica, 44 – – 44 <lb/>West Indies, 745 687 159 1,591 <lb/>The Cape, 315 8 – 323 <lb/>Australia and New <lb/>Zealand, 14,495 817 538 15,850 <lb/>56,213 5,811 28,719 90,743</p>
                <p>We have not the previous Returns at hand, <lb/>but we believe that a larger number of emigrants <lb/>never left the shores of the British Isles in one <lb/>year than the above. It is startling to think, <lb/>that 1800 persons quit the kingom every week <lb/>never to return. The natural increase of the <lb/>people must be about 1100 per day, of whom emi<lb break="no"/>gration carries off 250, leaving 850 to swell the <lb/>Census.</p>
                <p>The emigration to our North American colo<lb break="no"/>nies was as follows:–</p>
                <p>To Canada, 21,209 <lb/>–New Brunswick, 8,056 <lb/>– Newfoundland, 387 <lb/>–Nova Scotia, 972 <lb/>–Cape Breton, 437 <lb/>Prince Edward's Island, 1,214 <lb/>Hudson's Bay, 18 <lb/>32,293</p>
                <p>To Australia it was:– <lb/>Swan River, 224 <lb/>South Australia, 2,748 <lb/>Port Philip, 3,473 <lb/>Sydney, 7, <lb/>Van Diemen's Land, 299 <lb/>14,392</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Theatre Royal.</hi> –The Pantomine, we ob<lb break="no"/>serve, is postponed till Friday. Meanwhile, the <lb/>theatre is crowded nightly, the public being ad<lb break="no"/>mitted at second price from the commencement <lb/>of the performances.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Music Hall.</hi> –We stated, about two month <lb/>ago, that, in connection with other improvements <lb/>in the Assembly Rooms, a plan was under consi<lb break="no"/>deration for erecting a Music Hall. We are now <lb/>happy to announce, that at a meeting of the pro<lb break="no"/>prietors of the Rooms last week, full pwers were <lb/>given to the Directors to take the requisite steps <lb/>for carrying the design into execution. The de<lb break="no"/>sire so long felt by the cultivators of music here, <lb/>will soon be realisd, by the erection of a splendid <lb/>hall, constructed with a due regard to the accom<lb break="no"/>modation both of professional men and the public, <lb/>and with a minute attention to the most recent <lb/>improvements, by which full effect is secured to <lb/>musical performances when conducted on a grand <lb/>scale. By what may be called a propitious coin<lb break="no"/>cidence, Mr Bishop, the new Professor of Music, <lb/>arrived in Edinburgh on the very day when this <lb/>resolution was come to.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Martin's Paintings.</hi> –The exhibition of <lb/>these celebrated paintings in this city has already, <lb/>we believe, attracted many visitors. They are <lb/>truly wonderful creations, and possess a power <lb/>and grandeur of which the engravings, so familiar <lb/>to the public, convey but a faint conception. In <lb/>contemplating " the Deluge," the spectator is so <lb/>[?] [?] [?] <lb/>the scene, that he is apt to overlook the details; <lb/>but these will be found on inspection to be among <lb/>the most interesting features of the picture. The <lb/>groups of perishing beings are exquisitely wrought, <lb/>while everything is made to contribute to the <lb/>terrific grandeur of the catastrophe. The other <lb/>two pictures–"Pandemonium" and "the Rivers <lb/>of Bliss," are smaller in size, but equally indica<lb break="no"/>tive of the high poetic genius of the artist. No<lb break="no"/>thing could be more striking than the contrast <lb/>these pictures present to each other–the one fear<lb break="no"/>ful beyond expression, the other exhibiting a <lb/>heavenly serenity and loveliness on which the <lb/>eye rests with delight.

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Captain Ross' Discoveries.</hi> –Extracts from <lb/>Captain Ross' despatches have been published in <lb/>a Parliamentary paper. From the map which <lb/>accompanies the paper, we gain a more distinct <lb/>idea of his track than the previous article copied <lb/>from the <hi rend="italic">Athenean[?]</hi>  afforded. South Victoria <lb/>Land, which he discovered, extends in latitude <lb/>from 70 1/2 south to 79, how much farther is un<lb break="no"/>known; and in longitude its eastern coast lies <lb/>between 163 and 171. Its position is directly <lb/>south from New Zealand, and at the distance of <lb/>1500 geographical miles. The length of the part <lb/>seen was fully 500 miles. It was girt with a bor<lb break="no"/>der of ice many miles in breadth, which rendered <lb/>it inaccessible. The passage southward was closed <lb/>at latitude 78 by a barrier of ice 150 feet high, <lb/>which was traced for 300 miles east from Victoria <lb/>Land. Icebergs were encountered in numbers <lb/>after they passed parallel of 63, and pack ice <lb/>at 66. The land " rose in lofy peaks from 9000 <lb/>to 12,000 feet in height, perfectly covered with <lb/>eternal snow; the <hi rend="italic">glaciers</hi>  descended from <lb/>near the mountain summits, <hi rend="italic">project many miles </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">into the ocean,</hi>  and presented a perpendicular face <lb/>of lofty cliffs." They could not reach the main<lb break="no"/>land, but landed on an island, which they found <lb/>to consist of volcanic rocks. On 28th January, <lb/>in latitude 77 1/2, longitude 169 E., they discovered <lb/>a magnificent volcano, emitting smoke and flame <lb/>in a splendid profusion," and named it Mount <lb/>Erebus. An extinct one near it was named after <lb/>the other vessel, Mount Terror. At the distance <lb/>of less than half a mile from the ice cliffs which <lb/>barred their progress southward, they had sound<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>ings with 318 fathoms. These cliffs, no doubt, <lb/>reached the bottom, and, including the 150 feet <lb/>above water, <hi rend="italic">must have had an elevation fo 2000 feet </hi>
               <lb/>of thereabout. The observations on the dip and <lb/>declination induced them to place the South Mag<lb break="no"/>netic Pole in latitude 76, and east longitude <lb/>153; and they considered its position as well as<lb break="no"/>certained as if they had reached it, though their <lb/>nearest approach to it was a point 160 miles from <lb/>it, on the east coast of Victoria Land. The pole <lb/>is probably within that region, though this can<lb break="no"/>not be positively affirmed, as its western boun<lb break="no"/>dary is unknown. The highest latitude they <lb/>reached 78. 4. They were therefore only 12 <lb/>degrees from the pole and about 4 degrees nearer <lb/>to it than Captain Weddel[?], the most successful <lb/>of their predecessors. <cb/>

The <lb/>evening was very clear, the sky being without a <lb/>cloud, and the moon shining brightly. Suddenly, <lb/>a dazzling blaze of light burst from the sky, illu<lb break="no"/>minating Benlomond and the distant hills, the <lb/>Curse around Craigforth, and, indeed, the earth <lb/>and air on every side as far as the eye could reach, <lb/>with all the brilliancy of noon-day. The pheno<lb break="no"/>menon appeared like a ball of fire, of an oblong <lb/>shape, and apparently almost twice the size of <lb/>the moon, having at the time somewhat of the <lb/>same silvery appearance as that luminary, but <lb/>flaming with a brilliancy so intense as almost to <lb/>dazzle the eyes. A tail of fire somewhat re<lb break="no"/>sembling that of a rocket, but composed of the <lb/>most beautifully varied colours, streamed behind <lb/>it for a short distance, adding much to its spen<lb break="no"/>dour, and giving the whole an appearance at once <lb/>singularly magnificent and sublime. Before it <lb/>disappeared, it assumed a red glowing appear<lb break="no"/>ance, and then burst for an instant enve<lb break="no"/>loping the earth and sky in a blaze as bright and <lb/>dazzling as the most vivid lightning. It appeared <lb/>to pass from the south to the north, inclining to<lb break="no"/>wards the earth. To the eye it seemed to burst <lb/>and disappeared above Gargunnock. Another me<lb break="no"/>teor of the same kind, but much less in size, <lb/>brilliancy, and splendour, was observed falling in <lb/>a quartr rather farther to the south, a few mi<lb break="no"/>nutes previously.

This simple <lb/>circumstance was taken advantage of, though <lb/>nothing was lost thereby, and statements prejudi<lb break="no"/>cial to the town's credit were placed in the hands <lb/>of every credito that could be found by the indi<lb break="no"/>viduals referred to, and thus uncalled for alarm <lb/>raised. In addition to this, the adherents of the <lb/>same party in the Council during the last five <lb/>days gave currency to another statement which <lb/>they knew to be quite untrue, about the late Pro<lb break="no"/>vost having commenced to secure himself by <lb/>drawing a thousand pounds, when the fact was he <lb/>had not drawn out a penny. From the position <lb/>to which which the affiars the town are now driven <lb/>a full and public exposure of these matters will <lb/>soon be submitted to the creditors. The Council <lb/>have been negotiating for such a loan of money <lb/>as will pay off those who are dissatisfied, which <lb/>in the ordinary state of the money market they <lb/>would long since have obtained, though at present <lb/>that is difficult. As regards risk to the creditors, <lb/>from the best informed quarters we are assured <lb/>there is none. More than one-third of the whole <lb/>debts of the town are due to the Bank and the <lb/>members of Council, or their immediate friends, <lb/>and fully a half of the debt against the river is due <lb/>to the same parties. This we should conceive the <lb/>strongest proof that could be adduced of the con<lb break="no"/>fidence of those who should best know the state <lb/>of the town's affairs.– <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Chronicle.</hi>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Falkland Islands</hi>  have been nominally a <lb/>British colony for some years; but, in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of representations made to Government by <lb/>various persons interested in the trade to the South <lb/>Seas, a plan has at least been drawn up for esta<lb break="no"/>blishing a body of settlers in these islands. It <lb/>was submitted to the late Ministers, who referred <lb/>it to the Commissioners of Emigration and the <lb/>Lords of the Admiralty, by both of whom it was <lb/>approved. Rules were prepared by the Com<lb break="no"/>missioners of Emigration ; a vote of t3750 was <lb/>put into the estimates for the first year's ex<lb break="no"/>pense, and, we suppose, passed. If steps have <lb/>not been taken already to send out emigrants, we <lb/>presume they will be taken about the beginning <lb/>of next winter, which is their summer.</p>
                <p>These islands are about 300 miles from the <lb/>south extremity of the American continent, in a <lb/>latitude corresponding with that of London. <lb/>Their climate, however, very closely resembles <lb/>that of Shetland. They have cold summers and <lb/>mild winters. Snow seldom lies in them; but <lb/>owing to their humidity and want of sunshine, <lb/>and the stormy winds which blow almost con<lb break="no"/>stantly, wheat of barley could not be raised in <lb/>them, and even oats might turn out to be a pre<lb break="no"/>carious crop. It is doubted also if wood will <lb/>grow, and at present there is not a single tree in <lb/>the islands. Turnips and potatoes succeed well, <lb/>and there is an abundance of good grass, upon which <lb/>some thousands of black cattle, horses, and hogs, <lb/>thrive in the wild state, and sheep have been in<lb break="no"/>troduced and found to do well. Extensive peat<lb break="no"/>bogs exist, which will afford a sufficient supply of <lb/>fuel. The present population consists of twenty<lb break="no"/>five persons, young and old–one-half of them <lb/>British, the other Gauchos, South American In<lb break="no"/>dians of a semi-civilised description. They are <lb/>all stationed at Port-Louis, a fine natural har<lb break="no"/>bour, where a British officer resides.</p>
                <p>The islands are numerous, but all very small <lb/>except two, whose area is estimated at 13,000 <lb/>square miles, or nearly half the extent of Scot<lb break="no"/>land. They are deeply perforated by arms of the <lb/>sea, and probably afford a greater number of fine <lb/>natural harbours than any country of equal ex<lb break="no"/>tent in the world. Their shores afford excellent <lb/>fish of many kinds, and seals are exceedingly <lb/>numerous.</p>
                <p>The great object in establishing a colony here <lb/>is to provide a harbour of refuge and place of re<lb break="no"/>fitment for our ships frequenting the South Seas, <lb/>which are yearly increasing in number. Every <lb/>vessel going to the Pacific Ocean, or coming from <lb/>it, passes within sight of these islands, or near <lb/>them. At present 60 or 70 British ships pass <lb/>these islands annually coming from Chili or Peru, <lb/>and 20 more engaged in the whale fishery. The <lb/>trade to New South Wales employs 236 vessels, <lb/>most of which return to England by this route, <lb/>which will also be preferred by vessels trading to <lb/>New Zealand, Van Diemen's Land, Port Philip, <lb/>and probably South Australia. From Sydney or <lb/>Hort Town the distance is nearly the same by <lb/>Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope, but the <lb/>prevalence of westerly winds in the parallel be<lb break="no"/>yond the 30th, renders the latter route the more <lb/>advantageous on the outward voyage, and the <lb/>former on the return. The Falkland Islands are <lb/>about half as distant from Britain as New South <lb/>Wales.</p>
                <p>The Emigration Board recommend that Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should send out two surveyors to select an <lb/>eligible site for a town, and to lay out the land in <lb/>blocks of half a square mile, which may be subdivid<lb break="no"/>ed. It is proposed to sell the land to emigrants at <lb/>12s. per acre, and to expend part of the money in <lb/>carrying out additional settlers, part in defraying <lb/>the colonial outlay. There are 40,000 wild cattle in <lb/>the largest island, the privilege of shooting which, <lb/>or catching and taming them, might be sold to <lb/>the settlers or a company. The climate is unin<lb break="no"/>viting, but there is little doubt that persons ac<lb break="no"/>customed to grazing or sheep farming, or to seal<lb break="no"/>hunting, or deep-sea fishery, might drive a profit<lb break="no"/>able trade here. A vast number of ships, making <lb/>long voyages, American, French, Dutch, as well <lb/>as British, pass the islands, and to these it would <lb/>be a great accommodation to find supplies of pro<lb break="no"/>visions and the means of refitting here. Some of <lb/>our starving population in the North of Scotland <lb/>or the Islands, might better their circumstances <lb/>by removing to the Falkland Islands.</p>

                <p>( <hi rend="italic">From the Morning Chronicle.</hi>.</p>
                <p>The dinner given on Saturday by the New Zea<lb break="no"/>land Company to Lord John Russell will serve to re<lb break="no"/>move all apprehensions, if any are yet entertained, <lb/>with regard to the relations between that colony and <lb/>the Government of the parent state. Many of the first <lb/>names in the country honoured this splendid banquet <lb/>by their presence ; and men of all parties, Tories, <lb/>Whigs, and Radicals, appeared to be actuated only <lb/>by one common feeling.</p>
                <p>The public are now tolerably familiar with the <lb/>natural advantages of New Zealand, which appears <lb/>destined to be in the Souther Ocean what Great <lb/>Britain is in the Northern. Lord Ashburton, with <lb/>must felicity, observed, " that the position of the New <lb/>Zealand islands on the map, their climate, fertility, <lb/>abundant harbours surrounded with the seas most <lb/>suited to the whale fisheries, and, above all, the <lb/>character to the native population, led him to antici<lb break="no"/>pate that these islands were likely to become the <lb/>great seat of wealth and naval power." Lord John <lb/>Russell was justly complimented, on all hands, for <lb/>adding these important islands to the great colonial <lb/>empire of this country.</p>
                <p>The speech of Lord John Russell was much and <lb/>deservedly applauded.</p>
                <p>"I believe," said his lordship, "that the foundation <lb/>of this colony of New Zealand will tend to the honour <lb/>and dignity of the Crow, and will tend to the pros<lb break="no"/>perity and future greatness of the nation (cheers). It <lb/>was on this ground, and for these reasons, that I lent <lb/>my humble efforts in support of those exertions that <lb/>had been made, and were about to be made, by the <lb/>New Zealand Company. Gentlemen, in so doing, I <lb/>should be unworthy of your approbation if I took <lb/>any extraordinary merit to myself ; for, in the <lb/>first place, the principle of colonization, the value of <lb/>colonies to this country, the means they afford of aug<lb break="no"/>menting her strength, of adding to her power, of pro<lb break="no"/>moting her wealth, and of increasing her prosperity– <lb/>all this has been ascertained and demonstrated by the <lb/>enlightened discussions of past years (hear, hear). With <lb/>regard to the best mode of colonization, likewise, we <lb/>have had the advantage and assistance of the most en<lb break="no"/>lightened opinions, and the most adverse discussion <lb/>I, therefore, can only take to myself the merit of not <lb/>being blind to the importance and value of those opi<lb break="no"/>nions and discussions (hear, and cheers)"</p>
                <p>But though his lordship speaks thus humbly of his <lb/>own merits, in recommending the adoption of these <lb/>islands by the Crown, it was perfectly well understood <lb/>by all present that, for his conduct with respect to <lb/>his colony, he has truly entitled himself to the grati<lb break="no"/>tude of his country. Lord Ashburton only paid him <lb/>a deserved tribute when he complimented him for the <lb/>sagacity with which he had appreciated the import<lb break="no"/>ance of these islands, so soon as he had entered on the <lb/>administration of colonial affairs, and for the judicious <lb/>measure of setting up the British flag in them.</p>
                <p>We may observe that the health of her Majesty's <lb/>Ministers, proposed by Mr Hutt, M.P., was received <lb/>with loud and universal cheering, and that Mr La<lb break="no"/>bouchere's speech, which was a very good one, was <lb/>well received. Upon the whole, Lord John's visit to <lb/>the City on this occasion is calculated to gain the <lb/>Government favour among the commercial classes. <lb/>His lordship may well be proud, that though New <lb/>Zealand was formally taken possession of in the name <lb/>of the Sovereign of this country many years ago, it <lb/>was reserved for him to make it a British colony.</p>
