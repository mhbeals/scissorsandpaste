He know no other [?] than that he used in his trade ; therefore treating affairs of love as he did his business, after giving his friend in a letter several comissions, and reserving this for the last, he went on thus : Item[?], seeing that I have taken a resolution to marry, and that I do not find a suitable match for me here, do not fail to send me by next ship bound hither, a young woman of the qualifications and form following: As for a portion I demand none ; let her be of an honest family ; between 20 and 25 years of age ; of a middle stature, and well proportioned ; her face agreeable, her temper mild, her character blameless, her heatlh good, and her constitution strong enough to bear the change of the climate, that there may be no occasion to look out for a second through lack of the [?] soon after she comes to hand ; which must be provided against as much as possible, considering the great distance and dangers of the sea. If she arrives, and conditioned as abovesaid, with the present letter endorsed by you, or, at least, an attested copy thereof, that there may be no mistake or imposition, I hereby oblige and engage myself satisfy the said letter, by marrying the [?] at 15 days [?]. In witness [?] [?] I [?] [?], [?]. The London correspondent read over and over the odd article, which put the future [?] on the same footing with the bales of good he was to send to his friend ; and after adressing[?] the prudent exactness of the naturalized Creole, and his laconic stile, in enumerating the qualifications he insisted on, he endeavoured to serve him to his mind ; and after many enquiries, he judged he had found a lady fit for his purpose, in a young person of a reputable family, but no fortune ; of good humour, and of a polite education ; well shaped, and more than tolerably handsome. He made the proposal to her as his friend has directed, and the young gentlewoman, who had no subsistence but from a cross old aunt, who gave her a great deal of uneasiness, accepted it. A ship bound for the West Indies was then fitting out at Bristol ; the gentlewoman went on board the same, together with the bales of goods, being well provided with all necessaries, and particularly with a certificate in due form, and indorsed by the correspondent. She was also included in the invoice, the last article of which ran thus : Item, a maid of 21 years of age, of the quality, shape and conditioned as per order ; as appears by the affadavits and certificates she has to produce. Writings, which were thought necessary to so exact a man as the future husband, were an extract from the parish register ; a certificate of her character, signified by the curate ; an attestation of her neighbours, setting forth that she had for the space of three years lived with an old aunt who was intolerably peevish, and that she had not, during all that time, given her said aunt, the least occasion of complaint. And li[?]y, the goodness of her consitution was certified after [?] by [?] [?]. [?] [?] departure the London correspondent sent several letters of advice by other ships to his friend, whereby he informed him that per such a [?] he sent him a young woman of such an age, character, and condition &c. in a word, such [?] desired to marry. The letters of advice, the bales, and the gentlewoman came safe to the port ; and our Creole, who happened to be one[?] of the foremost on the pier and the lady's landing was charmed to see a handsome person, who having heard him called by his name, told him, Sir, I have a bill of exchange upon you, and you know that it is not usually for people to carry a great deal of money about them in such a long voyage as I have made ; I beg the favour you will pleased to pay it. At the same time she gave him his correspondent's letter, on the back of which was wrote, The bearer of this is the spouse you ordered me to send you. Ha, [?][?] ! said the Creole, I never yet suffered my bills to be protested, and I swear this shall not be the first : I shall reckon myself the most fortunate of all men, if you allow me to discharge it. Yes, Sir, replied she, and the more willingly, since I am apprized of your character. We have several persons of honour on board, who knew you very well, and who, during my passage have answered all the questions I asked them concerning you, in so advantageous a manner, that it has raised in me [?] for you. This first interview was in a few days after followed by the nuptials, which were very magnificent. The new married couple are satisfied with their happy union made by [?] of exchange, which was the most fortunate that had happened in that island for many years.  ID72 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	11 	15 	entertain 	A Transfer of Conjugal Love. On Monday last was married at Stockport, an inhabitant of Macclesfield, to a female on whom he had fixed his affections. It is to be observed, that he did not toil through the tedious forms of courtship, but at once got a wife, as others sometimes get good places, by purchase –and, as we are informed, the lady was valued at eight guineas and thirty yards of Irish cloth, at 2s. 6d. per yard–which property he deposited in exchange for earthly treasure. –Whether a wife may be cheap or dear at that price, time will shew. Her former husband, having seen military service, was not to be discomposed at trifles, and his philosophy probably being strengthened on the occasion, he attended the happy pair to church, and saw the marriage ceremony ; after which they spent the evening at the bridegroom's house, where all was gaity. The first husband parted with an helpmate had borne his sorrows twelve years ; and the second husband received a partner of his joys, after having buried a former one just a week.  ID74 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	11 	19 	entertain 	Curious Advertisement From the Pittsburgh Gazette Pittsburgh, Dec. 23, 1789. JULY the twenty-seventh day My wife Betsey ran away From bed and board,–and this did say, She would no longer with me stay. Since she has left me without cause I'll give her time enough to pause. That she may see her grievous error, When I live happy with a fairer. So I forewarn both great and small To trust her any thing at all, For of her contracts from this day One farthing's worth I will not pay. Dennis O'Bryan  ID84 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	11 	08 	entertain 	The Indian ships lately returned from Madras and Bengal, gives unfavourable accounts of all the branches of commerce, except that of matrimony, which has succeeded wonderfully in the last female exportations. Out of eleven ladies, who embarked on a marriage venture on board the Chesterfield, Captain Burgess, nine were connubially linked to weakly husbands within three months after their arrival and the other two were left in a way to complete this fortunate band of hymeneal adventu- rers.  ID207 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1828 	05 	07 	entertain 	Love in a Prison. –We have all heard that Love rules the court, the camp, the grove but we have rarely heard that the little god delighted to dwell in prisoned solitude ; true it is and of verity, nevertheless, that he seems, if not to have fixed his dwelling in, at least to be a very constant visitor of, our jail. It is not long since a couple, who had imbided the tender passion, were linked in the bonds of matrimony in it ; and a like consumnation, most devoutly to be wished for by another pair of inmates, would ere now have taken place, did not envious bolts and bars intervene, for a petition has been presented by two delinquents of different sexes, both under sentence of transportation, to the Magistrates, praying that they may be allowed to marry before setting out for New South Wales. The fond pair never saw each other till inclosed in the same vehicle on their way to stand trial at last Perth Circuit, for capital offences ; yet, in this situation, love–omnipotent love–took the captives captive, and rendered them in its enjoyment, even in their perilous plight, o'er a' the ills o' life victorious. But, alas! the course of true love never did run smooth; and no less a personage than the Secretary of State for the Home Department has in this case crossed the path of the hapless couple, and doomed them to single blessedness for many a year, by ordering the fair penitent to be removed to Penitentiary at Millbank for seven years, instead of transportation for fourteen ; leaving the forlorn lover to seek consolation in the charms of some sterling or currency damsel in the land of promise, to which he must now wend his solitary way.– Fife Hld.
