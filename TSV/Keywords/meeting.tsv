E. wind, succeeded in carrying her off, at six a.m. The captain and crew having refused to listen to their invitation to join them in their piratical undertaking, with the exception of the mate, were permitted to leave the ship in the boat, which reached Robin Island in safety about four o'clock the same day. By a letter received to-day we learn that the Admiral Gambier, Brash, laden with Government stores for Ceylon, was totally lost on the morning of the 20th of June last, having struck on the reef Roan de Nova, in the Mozambique Channel ; crew saved. A letter from Halifax, dated the 27th Nonember, says – Colonel Bouchette, Surveyor - General of Lower Canada, with Captain Campbell, of the 60th regiment, and Mr Bouchette, jun. arrived here on the 19th inst. The only information I can yet give you is, that the exploring survey has been extended from the source of the St Croix river to the river Restigouche, in line about 100 miles ; in this short distance both parties experienced difficulties and sufferings of the severest nature. The Americans employed on the same line with our English Commissioners are represented as men of great ability, and acting with that spirit of liberality that infuses confidence on each side, rendering their arduous task less severe and gloomy than was to have been expected in thie untrodden wilds of this quarter. Our trade continues dull, and money scarce. Government bills are 3 per cent advance, but expected to be lower, in consequence of the Commissary-General having refused to take the provincial notes. Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard –On Friday night, about half-past nine o'clock, this place was thrown into the greatest consternation, by the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard, the beating of drums, and the firing of the men of war's guns. It was occasioned by a fire having broken out in the house belonging to the steam engine erected for carrying on the new works situated in the southern part of the dock - yard, near the kilns used for burning cement stone. The most serious apprehensions were entertained for the safety of the arsenal ; and what was more distressing to the feelings of the spectators, was its coniguity to the workhouse, which, from the pressure of the times and want of employment, is crowded with many unfortunate individuals. Providence, however, averted the impending danger, and about twelve o'clock we had the pleasure of seeing the raging flames subdued, with only the loss of the engine-house. No lives, it is understood, have been lost, but one poor man is severely hurt. Captain Walker of the Northumberland, and the officers of that ship, Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter, and Captain Brown and the officers of the Ordinary, with the military officers and soldiers of the garrison, assembled on the first alarm. The latter were under arms the whole time, and were of great service in keeping off the spectators. The inhabitants of the twon were at one time under serious apprehensions, as the fire was not far from the Fountain tavern, and the residence of Mr Miller, in High Street. At the former, the landlady of the house had but recently lain in, and was removed on the first alarm being given. Sir Robert Barlow, from Chatham, who superintends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle, was here yesterday to investiage into the cause, which it is suspected arose from carlessness – The damage, however, has not been so great as was at first expected, and which it might have been but for the prompt and effectual assistance that was given – Sheerness, January 11  ID125 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1818 	01 	19 	inform 	Irish Emigrants. New York, Nov. 27. Nothing scarcely can be conceived more distressing than the situation of an unfriended stranger arrived here, from across the Atlantic, without the means of helping himself, and without even enough of acquaintance with the men and things about him to enable him to judge what path he should take to secure him the miseries of absolute want. Such, however, is actually the situation of hundres who annually land on our shores. To provide for those forlorn beings, several attempts have been made by associations of humane individuals here, but nothing hitherto has appeared to promising as that of which an account here follows: – At a meeting of Irishmen, and descendents of Irishmen, held at Harmony Hall, on Tuesday the 25th instant, for the purpose of promoting a Settlement of Irish Emigrants; Andrew Morris, Chairman, WM. Sampson, Secretary ; Upon the motion of Thomas Addis Emmett, the circular previously issues on this subject was read by the Secretary : – Circular It is a sentiment long felt, and often expressed, that something should be undertaken on behald of the emigrants who flock to these shores. Without any fixed destination, they remain in the sea port, until beocming victims of bad counsel and bad example, they lose the pure and honest energies with which they left their native land, and suffer worse than shipwreck in their moral qualities. The Government of this great Republic is well aware of the advantage to be derived from so great a mass of laborious industry, when usefully directed and employed–and of adding to the nation's strength, men whose attachment to the institutions of this country is assured by so many ties. But it is in the order of things, that some of the friends, particularly the countrymen of these emigrants, who have been some time established and known, should come forward to attest the necessity, and guarantee the solidity of the enterprise. If his has not been done sooner, it is because every advance in social improvement must come in its season. it is the ripeness of the occasion, and the voice of the times that now speak. It has been remarked that among the lands nows open for sale and settlement, there are some tracks, particularly in the Illionois territory, where the Irish emigrant, with the instruments to which his hands are accustomed, and in a climate congenial to his habits, might procure to himself immediate shelter and subsistence–and, in a few years, be able to repay with gratitude the benefits conferred on him. We, whose names are undersigned, have met to consult upon the means of promoting some establishment that might be a rallying point for the distressed, and give to the wanderer a habitation and a home. We have thought of no better way than to address, by this circular, the friends and well wishers of Ireland, who co-operation might give most weight to the measure, and to submit, whether it might not be advisable to join all our efforts, and petition Congress early in the ensuing session, for a grant of a suitable track, upon a credit of 14 or 15 years, subject to such conditions and modifications as the Government may see most fitting. to the Government we would offer no deceptive, delusive, or precarious motive, rather chusing to make its wisdom, benignity, and patriotism, the anchor of our hope. We request of our, if you approve of our sentiment and of our project, to advance and promote it by your best endeavours ; either by forming organized associations, or by obtaining individual signatures, to a petition to the effect stated. We have not yet been able to digest a plan, and have rather chosen to make this humble beginning, in hopes that we should soon receive additional light upon the subject from cor respondence we solicit. We shall, nevertheless, proceed to investigate the subject, and challenge the co-operation of good and respectable men, and request of you to do the same. You will please address your answers, and any future correspondence, to Mr James Moffit, No. 15. Frankfort Street New York. Thomas Addit Emmet. Denis M'Carthy, William Sampson, John R. Skiddy, James R. Mullaney, John Meyher, William James M'Neven, Cornelius Heeny, Matthew Carroll, Robert Swanton, James Moffit. New York, Nov 18, 1817 Mr Emmet then stated, that he had been requested by the gentlemen who called this meeting, to explain the objects for which it was convenued ; that it could not be necessary to expatiate before those he was now addressin, on the situation of the peasantry and farmers in Ireland ; it was at present one of unqualified misetry, partly occasioned by their local oppressions, and partly by the general calamities of Europe ; it compelled them to fly to these shores in such numbers, and under the pressure of so great poverty, that the most active individual benevolevence could neither provide them with a sufficient present succour, nor procure for them, within a reasonable time, the means of permanent settlement. The consequence was, that many of those unfortunate strangers were totally lost to this county, or forced by want to become noxious and dangerous to its cities, whose original dispositions and qualifications, if rightly directed and employed, would have made them valuable and useful members of the community. Besides, the accounts transmitted back to Ireland of their disappointments and destitute situations, deferred many who were suffering at home the extreme of wretchedness, from endeavouring to better their condition in this more fortunate and favoured land–to the political institutions of which they were also more strongly attached. A very painful reflection on these circumstances had suggested to come gentlemen then present the hope that the general Government might be induced, by a strong and united application, to grant a portion of its unsettled lands on terms liberal and bountiful, so that an asylum might be formed for industrious and enterprising farmers, who would gladly fly from famine and persecution to a spot where the sweat of their brows falling on a fertile soil would yield them a rich harvest, for their own exclusive benefit, and where they might peacefully enjoy all the blessings of that republication liberty they loved. The time for making such an application seemed auspicious ; party asperities had softened fown, and probably few would now be led by political prejudices to give it opposition. Neither was it unprecedented ; a favour nearly similar had been granted to the French emigrants, and to settlers from Switzerland. It is true we could not forth a pretence like the cultivation of the vine or the olive ; and we would not succeed by practising any delusion. We could offer nothing but an immediate accession of industrious and hardy settlers, who in a congenial soil and climate would become enthusiastically attached to the country and the Government from whence they derived all their blessings, and, wherever they were found, would form a barrier against every enemy. Much might undoubtedly be expected from the generous sympathy which the sorrows and sufferings of Ireland had everywhere excited in the United States, and from the acknowledged liberality of its Constituted Authorities ; but very forcible arguments might also be addressed to its policy and interest. Not only those that in the ordinary course of events would arrive here, whose usefulness is lost by the want of proper direction, and who become burdens or scourges to our cities, would be rescued and placed in a situation where all the energies of active and enterprising minds would be serviceable to themselves and the community ; but also the very fact that such an asylum was open and accessible, would infinitely increase the amount of emigration from Ireland, and people our wildernesses with incalculable rapidity. The place upon which we have fixed our eyes is in the Illinois territory–it has been lately purchased, and is not yet even surveyed. In the ordinary course of events, it is not likely to be brought into market (at least to any extent) for many years ; but if Congress listen to our application, and grant to the settlers an extended credit, Government will receive payment for the land probably as soon as if it were suffered to remain unheeded till its regular turn for sale came round. A large body of settlers will be enabled to grow rich during the time that the land would otherwise be waste and unproductive, and the value of all the contiguous property belonging to the United States would be rapidly and immensely increased, to say nothing of the advantages resulting from the strength of such a settled frontier. All these considerations may be strongly urged by men, who can most truly say they are actuated by no views of personal speculation or emolument ; who are willing to enter into all the labour of procuring settlers and organising the establishment, without any prospect of gain, or even compensation, except as to what may be necessary for defraying the expences of the undertaking ; and who are desirous that the actual settlers should enjoy all the advantages which Government may be willing to grant. These are our views–we conceive that they may be realized, if supported by an united and active co-operation of those who think like us in other parts of the Union. We are, therefore, desirous of adopting and pointing out to others what seems to be the best mode of giving system to that co-operation ; namely, the formation of societies totally divested of all party or political feelings, and directing the attention only to this object. There are already a sufficient number of political institutions in every State, in which the zealous partizan (be his opinions what they may) can act on them to their fullest extent. Let these societies be neutral groun, or rather consecrated places, in which, when we meet, we lay aside all our hostilities, and join as brothers in our prayers and offerings at the shrine of our common worship. They are consecrated to every man amongst us, by the purity of their object, by our earliest recollections, by our unbroken affection, and our strongest sympathies– by the unextinguished love of our native land, for which most of us have already renounced all sectarian antipathies and religious animosities ; which we offer as a solemn pledge to the country of our adoption, that our hearts will be always alive, from temperament as well as prin ciple, to the emotions of patriotism ; and that those amongst us who have pledged their faith to her, however they may seem to differ on some minor political subjects, will always be found firmly ranged and united under the same banners, and forming one phalanx whenever her more important interests are concerned. Mr Emmet then moved four resolutions, which being severally put, were carried with some slight amendments as follow :– 1. Resolved–That it is expedient to form a Society of Irishmen and descendents of Irishmen, for the purpose of endeavouring to procure from Congress a track of land in the Illinois territory, to be settled by emigrants from Ireland. 2. Resolved–That every person of the foregoing description, who shall, on or before the second day of December next, pay to the Secretary of this Meeting the sum of five dollars, shall be entitled to become a Member of the said Society, until the number of subscribers shall have amounted to one hundred, after which time the subscribers shall be at liberty to elect their own officers and no person shall afterwards be admitted except by ballot. 3. Resolved–That it be recommended in Irishmen, and the descendents of Irishmen, in the other cities and towns of the Union, to form similar societies for the purpose of corresponding and co-operating with that which is about to be formed in this city. 4. Resolved–That, as the meeting of Congress will shortly take place, and in order to prevent the less of time, a Committee of fifteen be appointed to prepare the outlines of a memorial to that body, to be submitted to the consideration of the Society, when formed and organized ; and also to adopt such measures as they may think expedient for promoting and accelebrating the organization of that Society. Mr John W. Mulligan, in seconding Mr Emmet's motion, expressed, in handsome terms, how much he was gratified by the invitation to attend, had given him the opportunity of claiming his title of descendent of an Irishman. A Committee was then appointed, pursuant to the fourth resolution, the number being, upon motion and discussion, augmented to twentyone. Committee –Andrew Morris, Thomas Addis Emmet, William Sampson, John W. Mulligan, Thomas Kirk, James Moffit, Robert Swanton, Matthew Carroll, William James M'Neven, Captain Skiddy, Dennic M'Carthy, John Meyher, James M'Bride, Cornelius Heeney, William Paterson, Colonel Mulaney, David Bryson, Captain O'Sullivan, James J. M'Donnell, Dennis H. Doyle, James Hayes. A subscription paper being then opened, a number of those present subscribed their names and paid five dollars as their initiation fee, and became members of the association. Those persons who wish to become original members may do so by signing their names and paying their subscription to the Secretary before 2d December, pursuant to the second resolution. After the meeting was adjourned, the Committee organized itself, and appointed Sub-Committees, to report a draft of a constitution and a memorial to Congress, and for the discharge of other requisite duties.  ID129 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1818 	09 	05 	inform 	Canada The inhabitants of Upper Canada have had another meeting, under the title of a Convention at York ; when they came to the following resolutions ; Richard Beasely, Esq. in the chair :– Resolved–1. That whilst this Convention holds it one one of the most sacred right of British subjects at all times directly to petition the throne of their Sovereign relative to their grievances, yet nevertheless, under the present peculiar existing circumstances of this country, the Members of this Convention, as well out of respect to that Honourable Body the Commons House of Assembly of Upper Canada, as for other causes, deem it their indispensable duty, on this important occasion, to recommend in the strongest terms to their fellow subjects resident in this province, a spirit, formal, and respectful application to that Honourable House, for an inquiry into the state of the province. 2. That John Clarke Cyrus Sumner, and Roderick Drake, Esqs. be a permanent Committee, for the management of the affairs of the Convention, and that they, as soon as may be practicable, prepare a respectful petition, praying for inquiring, and expressive of grievances (for the sanction of this Convention), to be by them circulated for subscribers, and presented at the bar of the House of Assembly at their next meeting session. That the said Committee be further authorised to frame and Address to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent, on the subject of grievances believed to exist in Upper Canada, which, when approved of by the Convention, shall be submitted by the Committee, together with the petition above mentioned, to the Honourable House of Assembly, at their next meeting, for their alterationg and amendment. Mr Gourlay, who has had so instrumental a hand in instigating these proceedings, is stated to have been arrested and held to bail, at Kingston, for distributing a printed account of the state of grievances of the people of the Niagara district ; and this by direction of the AttorneyGeneral of the province, who is reported to have influenced the Justice who signed the warrant, by certain threats of vengeance if he refused. Another report is mentioned as being in circulation, namely, that official instruction have been sent to particular Magistrates, to take notice of, and transmit to Government, the names of all persons holding commissions, civil or military, who engage in the measures of petitioning the Prince Regent, as recommended by Mr Gourlay, in order that they may be removed from their offices. The Upper Canada Convention met at York on the 6th inst. under the Presidency of Richard Bearly, Esq. J. P. It has styled itself a Convention of Friends to Free Inquiry, and resolved to change the proposed plan of sending deputies to England with a petition to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent, confining itself to an application to the House of Assembly for an inquiry into the state of the province, and a petition to his Royal Highness, to be presented to Sir Peregrine Maitland for transmission.– From the Quebec Gazette of July 31.  ID138 	Aberdeen Journal 	Aberdeen 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1819 	04 	28 	inform 	Colonial Intelligence. Halifax, March 13. A very numerous and respectable meeting of the inhabitants of this town was held at the Exchange Coffeehouse, on Saturday last, George Grassie. Esq. to the Chair. It was resolved unaminously–That the Legislature be petitioned to authorise the establishment of a bank in Halifax.–That 50,000l be the capital, to be invested in the British funds.–That notes to the amount of 150,000l be issued by the Bank.–That the shares be 100l each, and every five shares, according to a classification, entitled to a vote.–That the Bank be authorised to pay notes presented, either in specie, provincial paper, or bills of exchange on London at the current rate – A Committee was then appointed to prepare the Petition, and cause it to be presetned to the Legislature. The gentlemen present immediately afterwards unanimously agreed to give to the doubloun the value of 4l and to the sovereigh the value 1l, 2s. 6d. currency. The meeting then adjourned. York, Upper Canada, Feb. 6. Tex v. The Earl of Selkirk and others A bill of indictment, for a conspiracy to ruin the trade of the North West Company, and impoverish the partnes thereof, was found by the Grand Jury, against Thomas Douglas, Early of Selkirk ; J. B. Chevalier de Lorimer, Captain in his Majesty's Indian Department ; Captain Pratais D'Orsonnens, late of the De Meuron Regiment ; Captain Frederick Matthey, ditto ; Lieutenant G. A. Fauche, ditto ; Lieutenant Frederick Graffenrad, ditto ; Serjeant Jacob Vichie, ditto ; Captain Miles Macdonnel, late of the Canadian Fecibles ; Lieutenant Alexander Bridport Beecher, late of the Royal Navy ; Doctor John Allen, John Spencer, Donald Macpherson, James Chatelain, John M'Nab, Archibald Macdonald, and John P. Bourke. The indictment contains three counts ; and amongst the numerous overt acts therein set forth, supported by documentary and oral evidence, the following were particularly prominent :– The engaging and armind a number of disbanded soldiers (foreigners) ; the entry of them, by force of arms, into Fort William, in August, 1816 ; retaining possession of the fort till May 1817 ; sending off as prisoners the partners of the North West Company found there ; getting rid of the clerks, by subpoenas to appear at York at a period when no courts are held there, without ever inquiring whether they know anything of the matters to which the subpoenas related, and without ever bringing them forward afterwards ; stopping of the outfits from going into the interior, and the returns from coming into Montreal ; possessing themselves of all the books and papers of the concern ; sending away the principal clerk under a charge of felony, without examination, and without having ever followed up the charge ; the pretended sale, by Daniel Mackenzie, of the North West property, obtained by his Lordship by means of continued duress ; tampering with, and debauching the North West Company's servants, and commanding them in the King's name ; writing circular letters to the partners and clerks in the interior country, advising them to abandon their trust, alleging that the North West Company were ruined, and to carry the furs to Hudson's Bay ; taking possession of Fort Lake La Pluie, and the property there, and stopping the navigation, &c, &c. Upon this being returned a true bill the AttorneyGeneral moved the process of the Court against the parties ; and Dr Allen being present, was to be arraigned the following day. Wm Smith v. The Earl of Selkirk This was a civil action brough by Mr Wm Smith against Lord Selkirk for false imprisonment. It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff was undersheriff of the Western District, and as such, the bearer of a writ of restitution founded upon a verdict of a special jury at Sandwich, in October 1816, and granted by the Magistrate, ordering the restoration of Fort William to the North West Company. He was also the bearer of a warrant, for felony, issued against his Lordship, Dr Allen, Captain Matthey, and others, upon an information upon oath before a justice of the Peace. Mr Smith got to Fort William on the 19th of March 1817, and produced his writ of restitution, with which his Lordship refused to comply ; and when the Earl and others were arrested by Mr Smith, upon the warrant for felony, his Lordship laid hold of him and pushed him out of doors ; and he was afterwards kept in close custody in the fort under a military guard. A circumstance which added much to the grievous nature of the offence, and which was particularly dwelt upon by the Judge, in his charge to the Jury, was, that whilst Mr Smith was kept in a rigorous confinement, Charles de Reinhard, though under an accusation of was at large and keeping a school, though nominally under the surveillance of one or two of his former comrades. The Chief Justice also remarked upon another part of the evidence for the defence, by which it appeared that the only option left to Mr Smith to obtain his liberty was that of abandoning his duty, and breaking his oath of office, by a promise not to molest Lord Selkirk. Mr Smith, however, notwithstanding this proposal, persisted in doing his duty, and was not liberated until the evacuation of Fort William by his Lordship and his forces in May, 1818. The Jury after some deliberation, returned a verdict in favour of the plaintiff.– Damages L.500 Halifax currency. After narrating the military parages, &c. at Richmond, in America, in honour of the 22d of February, a journal says, A melancholy catastrophe closed the day. Colonel W. Tatham, so well known in England and this country, for his acquaintance with civil engineering.–who has been residing in this city for two or three years, but whose utility was considerably arrested by an unfortunate habit to which he had become addicted–was destined on that day to breathe his last.– In a moment of intemperance, as he stood by the piece of artillery which was firing the evening salute, he exclaimed that he wished to die. As the second gun was about to fire, and immediately after the commanding had given the word Fire! Conolonel Tatham presented himself in front of the muzzle of the piece, and by its discharge his abdomen was almost literally blown to pieces. His body was raised a few feet in the air by the explosion, and he fell upon his face without uttering one word that was heard by the byestanders.– Colonel Tatham died without any family. Circumstances had strip life of much of its attractions in his eyes ; but it is impossible not to regard the manner of his death with horroer, and to feel the deepest commiseraton for his melancholy fate. He was a man of great information, of great genius, and of great resource of mine. But to this melancholy end he has arrived.  ID257 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1836 	04 	09 	inform 	Sir George Clerk. –As the cawing of the rooks portends a storm, it is worth while to mention that the cunning baronet has come down from London, and commenced a canvass in this county within these few days. It is stated, we believe upon good authority, that he accounts for this course of proceeding, by referring to the great probability of the Lords throwing out the Irish Municipal Bill. Burn's Monument. –We understand that there is now an early prospect of the completion of this monument, which has too long remained in an unfinished state, to the surprise of strangers, and the discredit to our Modern Athens. The sum already in the Treasurer's hands, aided by the profits of the handsome musical work lately issued by Mr M'Leod, which he has generously devoted to that purpose, is now nearly sufficient to meet the calculations of the expense requird for the railing in and decoration of the ground around the monument. We expect, therefore, that the work will forthwith be commenced, and if a few pounds are still wanted, we have no doubt there are hundreds in Edinburgh who would willingly guarantee the Treasurer against any loss by the immediate completion of the undertaking. Annuity Tax. –We understand that deputations from several places in the country, are expected to attend the public meeting which is to be held on Tuesday evening, for the purpose of petitioning Parliament for the abolition of the Annuity Tax, in order to testify their abhorrence of that system of politico Christianity which requires distraint and imprisonment for its support. We observe that Mr Gillon, of Wallhouse, M.P. is to take the chair. The meeting we doubt not, will be most numerously attended. Law of Scotland. –The prizes given by Professor Bell, for the greatest proficiency in the examinations, were yesterday awarded to Mr William Neish, 25, India Street, in the senior, and to William Spence, 31, Broughton Place, in the junior class. The following gentlemen also distinguished themselves in the competition : Mr John Fraser, James Gilchrist, James Mason, James Scott, in the senior class; James Oliver, David Gale, John R. Banks, James Charles Murray, Wm. M'Naughton, in the junior. Kilwinning, March 30.–The United Associate Presbytery of Kilmarnock met at Kilwinning on Tuesday, the 22d March, and ordained Mr A. Macgregor to the pastoral charge of the congregation in that place. The Rev. D. Henderson, of Dalry, preached and presided. The Rev. Mr Cairns, of Stewarton, ordained, and the Rev D. Ronald, of Saltcoats, gave the charge to the minister and congregation. On the Sabbath following, the Rev. Mr Tait, of Barrhead, introduced Mr Macgregor to his congregation ; and there is every prospect that the hitherto long disappointed congregation of Kilwinning will now prosper under the pastoral care of their much esteemed and highly talented young minister. Presentation of Plate. –Mr A. S. Walker, late of the Commercial Bank of Scotland, at present manager of the branch of the Commercial Bank of England, at Uttoxeter, in Staffordshire, was lately presented with an elegant tea service by the proprietors of that establishment, bearing the following inscription :– Presented to Mr Archibald S. Walker, by the Uttoxeter Proprietors of the Commercial Bank of England, as a small acknowledgement of his faithful and valuable services–March, 1836. This is another proof of the estimation in which many of the young men are held who have been trained to the banking system in this country. From a Return, just published, we find that the emigration to Canada has been comparatively small last year. The whole number of emigrants landed at Quebec and Montreal in 1835, was 12,527 : in 1831 and 1832 four times, and in 1834 two times as many were sent out. Of the 12,527, there were 5597 adult males, 3866 females, and 3064 children under 14 years. Of the whole number, 1043 were sent out by parochial aid. The numbers from the three kingdoms were– England, 3067 Ireland, 7,108 Scotland, 2,127 From Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, &c. 225 Settled in Lower Canada, 2,297 Upper Canada, 9,800 Died at Grosse Isle and Quebec, 13 Returned to the United Kingdom, 117 Removed to the United States, 300 –12,527 But besides those who went to Canada, 16,749 landed at New York, raising the whole number of emigrants to 29,376. There were no less than three vessels wrecked last year on their way to Quebec– the William Ewing from Londonderry with 300 passengers, all saved–the barque James from Newfoundland, all saved–and the Nathaniel Graham from Cork, with 48 persons on board, passengers and crew, of whom 41 were lost. From another part of the Report, we find that 2764 female emigrants were sent out to Australia last year, under the superintendence of the Emigration Committee. Of these 2105 had a free passage. The arrangements seem to have been ood ; for the mortality was small, and few complaints were made. The females were all of decent character, and due care was taken on their arrival to get them disposed of as servants, in situations where their morals would not be exposed to unnecessary risk. Ulster Railway. –Length 36 miles, from Belfast to Armagh ; capital t600,000, in 12,000 shares, of which t393,000 are subscribed. The number of passengers expected is 450,000; the expected income is t93,000, of which t67,800 is from passengers ; the estimated expense of the work is t539,000. The steepest gradient is 1 in 200. There are 3 tunnels of 310, 320, and 570 yards in length. East Lothian Railway. –We call attention with great pleasure to the Prospectus of a railway from Dunbar to Edinburgh, by Haddington and Tranent, which appears in our first page. No one can have travelled over the ground without observing how admirably it is fitted for this species of communication, by its remarkable uniformity of surface. We should have doubted whether such a work would pay, had it terminated at Edinburgh ; but as a part of an unbroken line reaching across the most fertile and populous parts of Scotland, from the German ocean to the Atlantic, its chances of success are vastly increased. Dundee and Arbroath Railway. –The Committee's report on this railway has reached us, but we must confine ourselves to an abstract. The length is 16 miles 5 furlongs and 90 yards ; the capital t100,000, divided into 4000 shares, which is all subscribed, but authority is taken to raise t40,000 more by loan ; sum paid up t5000 ; subscribed by shareholders locally interested t88,900, by others t7150 : there are three subscribers for t2000 and upwards : the expected income from passengers is t16,912, goods t14,654, from both t31,566. There are no tunnels, no inclined planes, and the steepest gradient being only 1 in 1000, scarcely differs from a dead level. It does not cross any highway or turnpike on a level. The estimated expenses is t99,844. Statute Labour Acts. –It appears from the votes of the House of Commons, that a Select Committee has been appointed to investigate the Scottish Statute Labour Acts, and to consider what amendments may be made thereon. It may be stated, that by the present act for this county, proprietors of land, and several other descriptions of people are totally exempted from any burden, on account of the coaches, chaises, gigs, or saddle horses they may keep, though it is quite plain good roads are of as much advantage to them as to the occupiers of land, upon whom almost the sole burden is thrown. In many parishes a considerable addition would be made to the road funds, were no such exemptions allowed. At present the management is vested in heritors, rated at one hundred pounds Scots and upwards, though it is stated with confidence, that were the occupiers of land included, beneficial consequences would follow.– East- Lothian Correspondent. Leith Mechanics' Friendly Assurance Society. – The fifth annual meeting of this Institution was held on Tuesday last–John Hutton, Esq., one of the Honorary Members, President of the Society, in the chair. A very satisfactory report for the last year was read, and thanks were voted to the different Office bearers. It appears that this society was established under the countenance of the Magistrates and Ministers, and various influential individuals in Leith, and is well deserving of encouragement, as affording the benefits of mutual insurance to the working classes, the lowest rates consistent with perfect security. The funds, we understand, are in a prosperous state. Hay and Straw. –In consequence of it having been alleged last Wednesday, that higher prices were got for straw than those quoted, we have made due inquiry, and find there are no grounds for such an allegation. We have been further assured, that in reporting the prices of hay and straw for these two years past, the clerk of the corn market has never shown a desire to favour the farm servants at the expense of their employers, or to favour either party at the expense of the public. The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have been pleased to grant by their warrant, dated the 6th of April 1836, a distinguishing flag to be worn by the respective vessels belonging to the Eastern Regatta Club of Scotland, viz. a blue cornet flag, with a white St Andrew's cross on the upper quarter on a red field. Heriot's Hospital. –At the meeting of the Governors of George Heriot's Hospital, on Thursday the 7th instant, the estimate of Messrs Trotter for alterations and repairs on the chapel, amounting to t935, was accepted, and it will gratify the friends of economy to learn, that this is t65 under the sum voted by a majority of the Governors for that purpose some time ago. Thereafter a unanimous vote of thanks was passed to Councillor Gillespie Graham, for gratuitously furnishing a plan of the intended improvements on the chapel, which was described by Councillor Grant and others, as highly creditable to the skill and good taste of that distinguished architect. The Governors then proceeded to consider the list of applications for admission of boys, preparatory to the usual half-yearly election. There were 16 vacancies and 37 applicants, who may be thus classed :– Those who have never received benefit from George Heriot's Hospital, or any other institution, 12 Those who have received benefit for one child, 13 Do. for two children, 6 Do. for three children, 5 Do. for five children, 1 37 In considering cases the present practise of the Governors is to give preference, first to children of widows (being poor), then to those who have never received benefit, afterwards those who have had only one child in, and so on. These were but three applications for widow's children, and one for an orphan, out of the above number, and it is therefore probable, considering the large population of Edinburgh, that it is not sufficiently known, that George Heriot, in his will, expressly points out the fatherless and poor, being children of burgesses and freemen, as the objects of his charity–hence, if there be not a sufficient numbers of really necessitous cases, the Governors, in filling up the vacancies, may elect some that do not appear to have strong claims, simply from those that have such claims not coming forward in sufficient numbers. Political Economy. –On Thursday last the course of lectures on Political Economy, delivered by Dr Thomas Murray, in Elder Street Chapel, was brought to a conclusion ; on which occasion the thanks of the meeting were, on the motion of one of the members of committe, voted by acclamation to the lecturer for his valuable services. After thanks had been returned by Dr Murray, Mr A. G. Hunter, merchant, was called to the Chair, and some conversation having taken place, the committee of management, who had necessarily been self-elected, were confirmed by the meeting in their office, and empowered to take such steps as they might think expedient for obtaining lectures to the industrious classes next winter. We understand that Dr Murray is to be entertained at supper, some evening next week, on the occasion of being presented with a piece of silver plate. It is with much regret we learn that John Grieve, Esq. of Newington Cottage, died on Monday last. He was beloved and esteemed for his estimable qualities by all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance, and his death will be long and deeply regretted. Rare Sights in London. –A young Scottish Miss, who had voyaged the length of London on a pleasure jaunt, returned the other day by one of the steamers, and was met on landing by various members of her family, who anxiously inquired what she had seen in London. Seen ! exclaimed the fair tourist I have seen such sights ! I saw the Theological Garden, and all the wild beasts in't! The Theatre.–Mr C. Kean concluded his engagement on Thursday evening–an engagement the longest and most brilliant of any that our Theatre has witnessed for many years. Mr Kean has been with us for a whole month, and has succeeded in crowding the house almost every night. We understand that upwards of 30,000 persons have visited the theatre during his engagement–a number beyond that of any former period of equal duration. In that time he has appeared in some of the most arduous and difficult of Shakespeare's characters Hamlet, Richard, Macbeth, Othello, Shylock, and King John, investing each with its own peculiar charms and interest, and exciting the highest admiration and astonishment at the versatility and power of his genius, which could give such individuality and truth to so many dissimilar, distinct, and separate classes of characters. The play with which his engagement concluded was Richard, which character he has performed seven times during his engagement ; the house was, as usual, crowded in every part, and he exerted himself most strenuously and successfully. At the conclusion the cheers of the audience were loud and long, and two laurel wreaths were thrown upon the stage from different parts of the house. Mr K. being loudly called for, appeared in front of the stage, and delivered the following very neat and appropriate address:– Ladies and Gentlemen, –I now stand before you for the last time this season, but believe me whichever way my pilgrimage may bend, my thoughts will ever recur to Edinburgh as those of a child to its distant home, fondly anticipating the hour when he shall again stand upon its threshold. (Great cheering.) Till that period permit me with a heavy, but a grateful heart, to pronounce that melancholy word– farewell. (Mr Kean then withdrew amidst reiterated and enthusiastic plaudits from all parts of the house.) –Mr K. we perceive, appears next in Aberdeen, where the people are anticipating a rich treat from his performances. The boxes there, we are told, are already taken for several successive nights to come.– Mrs Honey, from the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, makes her appearance here on Monday first. On Wednesday evening, Mr John G. Moxey, baker, Castle Street, was entertained at supper, in Menzie's Hotel and Tavern, Waterloo Place, by a party of friends, of about fifty in number, previous to his leaving this country for America, to which he is about to emigrate. The company was very harmonious, and the compliment must have been very gratifying to Mr Moxey. Qualifications of General Assembly Elders. –The Presbytery of Cupar, at their meeting on the 29th ult. elected the Earl of Leven and Melville, and Walter Malcolm, Esq. Edinburgh, to represent them in the ensuing Assembly. Mr Malcolm is factor for Captain Hay of Mugdrum, who is principal heritor in the parish of Newburgh, and was lately ordained an elder there. Against his election to serve in the Assembly a protest and appeal were taken, on the grounds, as we understand, that he has no domicile within the bounds of Presbytery, and is not an officiating elder; the protesters allowing that his election, though consistent with the letter, is contrary to the spirit of an act of Assembly passed in 1816. If the appeal is sustained, it is evident that a large proportion of the Assembly elders must vacate their seats. Intimation also was given by D. Maitland M'Gill, Esq., that when the commissions came to be attested, he would move for evidence being produced that the elders-elect maintain family worship. An amusing inquiry was instituted in the Presbytery last year respecting the Earl of Leven's habits of domestic devotion ; and a clerical member had the candour to say, he should wish to know how it was with the ministers themselves in that respect. The University of St Andrews has just conferred the degree of Doctor of Divinity on the Rev. Professor Paxton, of Edinburgh. In bestowing this public honour on one, who, during a long and useful life, has done so much for the cause of literature and religion, the members of the College have done an act which shows that they can appreciate real merit, and which will entitle them to the gratitude of the religious public of Scotland. Those who have had the good fortune to enjoy the public ministrations of Professor Paxton, and even the general church-going community, are well aware of the rich and glowing eloquence, of the pious and heartfelt warmth, and of the classical elegance which have long characterised his public preaching. Even beyond the religious body of which he is the ornament, he is well known as one of the most popular and impressive teachers of the day. In his lectures on Theology, as Professor to the General Associate Synod, and afterwards to the Associate Synod, he displayed the results of an extensive and profound critical study of the Scriptures, and of an unwearied research into the Natural History, and the manners and usages of the ancients nations. The work by which he is chiefly known as an author– The Illustrations of Scripture –will long bear testimony to the extent of his learning, and of his Oriental investigations, and to his powers of lucid and eloquent composition. We understand that the attention of the College was directed to Mr Paxton's merits by the distinguished Professor of Oriental Languages. This anxiety to do justice to a fellow labourer in the same field of study, reflects high honour on the discrimination and the heart of Mr Tennant. Public Dinner to Professor Dick. –On Tuesday last, the Students ofthe Edinburgh Veterinary College and a number of Veterinary Surgeons and other gentlemen (in all upwards of 70) from various parts of Scotland, entertained Professor Dick to a public dinner in the Waterloo Hotel. John Lambert, Esq. in the Chair, and Alexander Gordon, jun Esq. croupier. The stewards were Ed. Pyper, Esq. of West Craigs, J. R. Laing, Esq. jun of Dunkenny, Samuel Wordsworth, jun. Esq. W.S., Dr Malcolm, James Miller, Esq. and George Rennie, Esq.– Amongst the gentlemen present we observed Professors Low and Lizars ; Drs Robertson, Spittal, Knox, and Aitken, Mr Ferguson, surgeon ; J. B. Murdoch, Esq. of Coldoch; Charles Gordon, Esq. Secretary to the Highland Society of Scotland ; A. T. Blackwood, Esq. of Oggs Castle ; Mr Dick, senior &c. The cloth having been removed and the usual loyal toasts drank, the chairman, in a neat and appropriate speech, proposed the health of Professor Dick, to whom the present meeting had assembled to do honour, and who at once commanded their esteem as a member of society and their admiration as a man of talent, which toast was drank with the greatest enthusiasm. The chairman then proposed his Grace the Duke of Gordon and the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, Patrons of the Edinburgh Veterinary College, which was followed by a variety of other appropriate toasts. Many excellent songs were sung, and the conviviality of the evening was kept up until a late hour. Royal Infirmary –We understand that the Stewards of the late Fancy Ball for the benefit of the Royal Infirmary have, by their judicious arrangements in the management of the ball, been enabled to pay over to the trustees of that institution, (after deducting all expenses) the sum of t432, 7s. 8d. The managers of the Infirmary, as well as the public at large, are certainly much indebted to the gentlemen who acted as stewards upon that occasion, for their valuable extertions, particularly at the present time, in support of this great and useful institution, for the relief of those labouring under the united calamities of indigence and disease.
