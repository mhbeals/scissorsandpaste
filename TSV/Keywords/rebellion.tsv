On the afternoon of Saturday last, the specie seized on board the Lake Champlain steam-boat, amounting to upward of 12,000 dollars, arrived at his Majesty's cash-office here, under the escort of the 19th light dragoons from St John's. At length we have authentic accounts relating to the expedition of Lord Selkirk ; they are very important, as many ex parte details have been published - his taking Fort William by storm, making all the partners of the North West Company prisoners, &c. ; but the cause of the expe dition has never been explained. The Canadian Courant puts it in a very clear point of view:– Mr Robert Semple, the Governor-General The Hudson's Bay Company on the Red River, towards the close of the year 1815, took possession of two establishments belonging to the North West Company, which had obtruded themselves on the territory of the Hudson's Bay Company. The North West traders then altered their route, going into the Upper Country by circuitous ways, by which much delay took place ; and in order to try Mr Semple, they sent two cartloads of provisions by the former track in June last, with a guard of fifty men ; the advance, twenty-two of the number, fell in with one of the natives, whom they took forward with them to prevent discovery. The rear-guard passed within four miles of the settlement ; they were perceived by the Governor, and were attacked by a party from the garrison, consisting of about thirty soldiers ; an engagement took place, stated on the 19th of June. Mr Semple and 21 of his men were killed ; the rest of his forces returned defeated to the fort ; it is on this account that the expedition of Lord Selkirk was undertaken. The manner of Lord Selkirk's conducting the expedition we do not justify, nor indeed can we form any opinion on the subject without further authentic details ; it is, however, but justice to say, that the Hudson's Bay Company have rights, and are a chartered Company ; the North West Traders, though we believe a most respectable body, are only an Association of Merchants.  ID120 	Aberdeen Journal 	Aberdeen 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1816 	12 	16 	inform 	Canada Lord Selkirk We have been favoured by a Gentleman in this city, with the following interesting and authentic communication, on the subject of the dispute between Lord Selkirk, and the Gentlemen of the North West Company: Extract of a Letter from Montreal, dated 6th October, 1816. In the newspapers which I sent you, you will see some accounts of the disturbances which have taken place in the North West between the North West Company and Lord Selkirk's colonists. The latter have been obliged to leave the Red River, after having had 22 of their men, including Governor Semple, killed by a party of half-breeds, the spurious offspring of the North West Company. As yet have not had an accurate statement of that melancholy transaction. Lord Selkirk's party state that these half-breed with some of the North West Com pany servants, came to destroy the settlement, and that Mr Semple, with about 25 of the Colonists, went out to meet them, to know what could be their intentions, when those rascals commenced firing on them, and massacred all but three, who were fortunate enough to make their escape. The North West people's account is that these half-breeds with some Indians were bringing down provisions from the upper part of the Red River to the entrance near Lake Winipie, and as the Colonists had the command of a great part of the river, they were obliged to pass in the rear of the settlement, which being observed by Governor Semple, who was on the look-out for them, he settled out of his Fort with 25 men and a [?]-piece to take from the Indians the provisions which were intended for the North West Company ; that the result[?] was an engagement which terminated in the defeat of the Colonists, of whom twenty-two were killed. Lord Selkirk [?] from Montreal for the Red River about the latter end of June, when[?] three or four officers and about 150 men of De Men[?]'s regiment, which had been disbanded, and when he arrived at Fort William on Lake Superior, hearing the fate of his Colonists, he[?] immediately issued a warrant against Mr M'Gillivray for high treason, conspiracy and murder, and subsequently warrants against all the partners of the N. W. Company, who were at F William, [?] formal possession of their establishment there, and sent Mr M'Gillivray, with about ten others, prisoners to Montreal, with all their papers [?] a number of packs of Beaver and other Furs, and several bales[?] of Merchandise, which he found in possession of the North West Company, belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company. The Police Officers in Montreal were several days examining the papers, and about four or five days after the arrival of Mr M'Gillivray and the others, they were admitted to bail, to appear to take their trial at the next criminal court, or any court of Oyer and Terminer which may be appointed. Stuart (the ci-de vant Solicitor-General, who was dismissed by Sir James Craig, and at whose instance an ineffectual attempt was lately made by some misguided members of our House of Assembly to impeach Chief Justices Sewell and Monk) is one of Lord Selkirk's counsel and spoke at great length, and what his friends and admirers call very eloquently, strongly opposed their being admitted to bail, but all would not do, and they were accordingly bailed ; Mr M'Gillivray in sureties of t1000 and the others in t500, sums inconsiderable enough, advering to the high crimes and misdemeanours with which they were charged. In the Montreal Herald you will see a very learned, and (as our neighbour Jonathan would say) a lengthy communication, signed Montius[?], setting forth the rights which the Hudson's Bay Company by their charter possess over the Countries which they have granted to Lord Selkirk, and the power vested in him of appointing Governors and other Officers to superintend and regulate the Colony. Being a masterly production, it will no doubt makes its appearance in a pamphlet, and when it does, I shall send you one, in case the papers should miscarry. It is uncertain whether the Earl will remain in the North West during the winter, or come down to Montreal ; if the latter, he must be down[?] soon[?], as the season for water-travelling will shortly close. Montreal is now divided into two parties, one favouring the Lord, and the other the North West Company ; and with the exception of the friends of the latter, strongly in favour of his Lordship.  ID144 	Aberdeen Journal 	Aberdeen 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1819 	06 	02 	inform 	Colonial Intelligence Advices have been received again from the Cape of Good Hope of 6th March, which are several days later than those acquired formerly. Of the rising of the Caffres there remains no doubt, although it does not appear that Government have as yet received official information regarding it. The private accounts state that two valuable officers had lost their lives, and also a great number of men. The Governor himself in order by his presence the sooner to suppress the Caffres, had, with a competent force, proceeded to the interior. Great inconvenience was experienced for the want of cavalry in so extensive a country ; had not this been the case, it was believed that in a very few days tranquility would have been restored. We are sorry to state that another hurricane has taken place in the Isle of France ; it commenced on the 25th January, and has done great mischief to the shipping, and also to the plantations of that ill-fated Island. A Dutch mail has arrived, with papers to the 19th inst. At Batavia, two of the leaders of the late disturbances have been tried and execute, and that degree of tranquility which terror produces has been restored. In the administration of their colonies in the east, the conduct of the Dutch has always been cruel and oppressive ; and it is to be regretted that the extensive and fertile island of Java should have been surrendered to their rapacity. During the short time that it was in possession of this country, various important improvements were introduced into its domestic administration ; the practise of torture, according to the humane and enlightened maxims of British jurisprudence, was abolished ; new and better modes of collecting the revenue were adopted ; and a spirit of mildness and of regard for the interests of all the various classes of which the population is composed, was evinced, which made the British Government highly popular. Considerable anxiety prevails among the merchants for the safety of the Queen Charlotte, Jamaica packet. She sailed from Jamaica the 29th March, and had a great quantity of specie on board. No things have since been received of her. Several vessels sailed since her departure, and have arrived safe. The Ocean quitted Jamaica on the 6th of April, and arrived here several days since. Several passengers landed at Portsmouth on Thursday from Jamaica, bring Port Royal Papers to the 25th of March. The 50th Regiment had arrived at Kingston, from Cork ; and the 2nd West India Regiment was about to embark for Sierra Leone to be disbanded.  ID273 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1838 	09 	22 	inform 	The King of Prussia and his Catholic Sub- jects. –The German Courier in an article date Berlin, 5th instant, refers to the late arrests in Posen, and accuses the Catholic clergy of stimulating their flocks to revolt. The Prussian Government had, in consequence, increased its exertions to conciliate the Court of Rome, in hopes that its influence would be exercised over the clergy, and induce them to return to their allegiance. On the other hand, the sect of Separatists, who had resolved to emigrate from Austria to Australia, because of the interference of Government with their religious belief, amounted to 40,000 souls. It was said they would be joined by a great number of the inhabitants of Pomerania.  ID344 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	05 	17 	inform 	Kingston, Feb. 6. By a St. Christopher's paper of the 25th ult. we learn, that the small-pox raged lately at >Surinam, to such a degree that, within the space of two months, upwards of 2500 persons had perished by that disorder. A very severe shock of an earthquake was felt between give and six on the evening of last Thursday se'ennight, at the settlements near the Blue Mountains. On Wednesday the 3d instant, arrived at Lucca, the ship Pitt, Captain Hunter, from Africa with154 Gold-Coast Negroes. On the passage from Africa, nine of the seamen mutined, whom Captain Hunter has brought confined in irons, and they are to be tried at a Court of Admiralty Sessions. Feb. 20. Very strong suspicions are entertained by the Americans, that the Indian Chief M' Gilveray, and the nations under his immediate controul, or in alliance with him, are subsidied by the King of Spain. It is a well known fact, that they are regularly supplied with cloathing, arms and ammunition, from the Royal Magazines at St. Augustine and Pensacola, and therefore in all probability; the sword not the olive branch, will be the most speedy and effectual agent for terminating the disputes. March 6. Tuesday last arrived in the harbour of Port Royal, from Cork, his Majesty's ship Chichester, of 44 guns, armed en flute, Lieutenant Craven, Commander, having on board the first battalion of the first or Royal Regiment of of foot, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Dundas. The other Officers are–Captains, Duncan, Franer, Pemberton, and Mannoch; Lieutenants, Sir W. Jas. Cockburne, Bart. Nicholson, Puxley, Clunes, Browne, Clarke, Drummond, and Graham; Adjutant, Sir. W. J. Cockburne, Bart. Quartermaster, Mr. Davidson, Surgeon, MR. Young; Ma?e, Mr. Bolton. The troops in the Chicester amount to 500 men, exch??e of 100 women and children. Colonel Hunter is appointed superintendent of the settlement at the Bay of Honduras, in the room of Colonel Despard, recalled. Col. Hunter came out with the earl of Effingham; it is therefore probable that the disputes which have so long subsisted between Lieutenant Colonel Despard and the inhabitants of the Bay of Honoduras, will be brought to a speedy determination. At the sale of the late Peter Heningson's estate,a negro blacksmith was sold for the extraordinary sum of two hundred and sixty pounds! At two o'clock on Tuesday morning the 3d regiment quitted the barracks in this town and at Up Park Camp, and embarked on board the Chichester for Great Britain; the 14th at the same time taking possession of their quarters. Advice is received from St. Mark's in Hispaniola, that, on the 1st of this month, a number of free people of colour, to the amount of 700 and upwards, having possessed themselves of several field pieces, formed a camp in that districh, and exhibited an appearance of hostility highly alarming. A deputation of five gentlemen being sent from the Assembly to demand the reason of so extraordinary a proceeding, the insurgents demanded, that a remonstrance which they then delivered to the deputies, should be presented imimmediately to the general, and that an answer thereto should be given without delay. The paper being conveyed as they desired, proved to be a sensible and well written detail of the various claims the free people of colour had on what they termed the justice of the whites, with whom they demanded an equal participation of all rights and immunities whatsoever–the privilege of representation, and of qualifying for all the learned professions–and concluding with the avowal of a determination to proceed to extremities should their demands be treat with neglect. On the perusal of this paper, it was judged adviseable to assemble a body of the militia, who headed by the General, immediately went against the camp. On their arrival the insurgents fired and fled to the mountains; three or four of the whites were killed, and one of the ringleaders was taken and instantly beheaded. A proclamation was then issued, offering a reward of 50 half joes for the head of any principal offender, and in the course of a few days not less than twenty seven were brought in. On Sunday the 7th instant, a very great majority of those who had formed the camp, finding all their attempts completely frustrated, came in and took the oath of allegiance to the nation. One or two of the principals, for whom high rewards are offered, are not yet taken. From Port Maria we have received the disagreeable account of the loss of the ship Lion, Capt. Smith, belonging to Liverpool: a violent breeze on the 5th instant drove her from her anchors, and she now lies stranded on the beach.
