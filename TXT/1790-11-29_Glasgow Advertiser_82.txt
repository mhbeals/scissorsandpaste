Extract of a letter from Dublin, Nov. 23."The drafts at Cork yesterday received the agreeable orders to return to their respective regiments immediately."The officers appointed to raise independent companies in Ireland, have received orders to repair forthwith to England, with whatever complement of men already entered, but not to proceed with the completion of their number : in conference to this order, they are preparing for their immediate departure."Last Tuesday two eminent merchants of this city received orders, by way of a vessel arrived at Cork, from Mess de Fouseca Olivarez and Co. at Seville, for the immediate exportation of cotton, white linen, and mixed goods, to a very large amount."Monday evening the Elizabeth and Mary, Mark Purcell, master, arrived at Waterford from Annapolis, in Maryland, after a long and dangerous passage, of 52 days, in which they had nearly exhausted the whole of their provisions, having been a very short allowance of half a naggin of rum, diluted with one pint of bad water, for twenty-four hours. She is heavy laden, having on board six hundread hogsheads of tobacco, a large quantity of pipe staves, barrel hoops, &c. and has been expected more than two months. Eight per cent was offered as insurance on ship and cargo, but refused, on account of the then probability of a war."
